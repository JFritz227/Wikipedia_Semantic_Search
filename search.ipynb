       "  'raw page text': 'Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance growth reproduction health and disease of an organism It includes food intake absorption assimilation biosynthesis catabolism and excretion The diet of an organism is what it eats which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods For humans a healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation heat or leaching and that reduce risk of foodborne illness In humans an unhealthy diet can cause deficiencyrelated diseases such as blindness anemia scurvy preterm birth stillbirth and cretinism or nutrient excess healththreatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease diabetes and osteoporosis Undernutrition can lead to the wasting of kwashiorkor in acute cases and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition    History of human nutrition Antiquity  The first recorded dietary advice carved into a Babylonian stone tablet in about 2500 BC cautioned those with pain inside to avoid eating onions for three days Scurvy later found to be a vitamin C deficiency was first described in 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus According to Walter Gratzer the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century BC In China the concept of qi developed a spirit or wind similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma Food was classified into hot for example meats blood ginger and hot spices and cold green vegetables in China India Malaya and Persia Humours developed perhaps first in China alongside qi Ho the Physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements Wu Xing fire water earth wood and metal and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets About the same time in Italy Alcmaeon of Croton a Greek wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out and warned that imbalance would result in disease marked by obesity or emaciation The first recorded nutritional experiment with human subjects is found in the Bibles Book of Daniel Daniel and his friends were captured by the king of Babylon during an invasion of Israel Selected as court servants they were to share in the kings fine foods and wine But they objected preferring vegetables pulses and water in accordance with their Jewish dietary restrictions The kings chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial Daniel and his friends received their diet for ten days and were then compared to the kings men Appearing healthier they were allowed to continue with their diet Around 475 BC Anaxagoras stated that food is absorbed by the human body and therefore contains homeomerics generative components suggesting the existence of nutrients Around 400 BC Hippocrates who recognized and was concerned with obesity which may have been common in southern Europe at the time said Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food The works that are still attributed to him Corpus Hippocraticum called for moderation and emphasized exercise  Salt pepper and other spices were prescribed for various ailments in various preparations for example mixed with vinegar In the 2nd century BC Cato the Elder believed that cabbage or the urine of cabbageeaters could cure digestive diseases ulcers warts and intoxication Living about the turn of the millennium Aulus Celsus an ancient Roman doctor believed in strong and weak foods bread for example was strong as were older animals and vegetables Galen to Lind One mustnt overlook the doctrines of Galen In use from his life in the 1st century AD until the 17th century it was heresy to disagree with him for 1500 years Galen was physician to gladiators in Pergamon and in Rome physician to Marcus Aurelius and the three emperors who succeeded him Most of Galens teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by Benedictine monks at the School of Salerno in Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum which still had users in the 17th century Galen believed in the bodily humours of Hippocrates and he taught that pneuma is the source of life Four elements earth air fire and water combine into complexion which combines into states the four temperaments sanguine phlegmatic choleric and melancholic The states are made up of pairs of attributes hot and moist cold and moist hot and dry and cold and dry which are made of four humours blood phlegm green or yellow bile and black bile the bodily form of the elements Galen thought that for a person to have gout kidney stones or arthritis was scandalous which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butlers Erehwon 1872 where sickness is a crime  In the 1500s Paracelsus was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly Also in the 16th century scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci compared metabolism to a burning candle Leonardo did not publish his works on this subject but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely disagreed with Galen Ultimately 16th century works of Andreas Vesalius sometimes called the father of modern medicine overturned Galens ideas He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the eras mysticism and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo Jan Baptist van Helmont who discovered several gases such as carbon dioxide performed the first quantitative experiment Robert Boyle advanced chemistry Sanctorius measured body weight Physician Herman Boerhaave modeled the digestive process Physiologist Albrecht von Haller worked out the difference between nerves and muscles Sometimes forgotten during his life James Lind a physician in the British navy performed the first scientific nutrition experiment in 1747 Lind discovered that lime juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from scurvy a deadly and painful bleeding disorder Between 1500 and 1800 an estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy The discovery was ignored for forty years after which British sailors became known as limeys The essential vitamin C within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists until 1932 Lavoisier and modern science  Around 1770 Antoine Lavoisier discovered the details of metabolism demonstrating that the oxidation of food is the source of body heat Called the most fundamental chemical discovery of the 18th century Lavoisier discovered the principle of conservation of mass His ideas made the phlogiston theory of combustion obsolete In 1790 George Fordyce recognized calcium as necessary for the survival of fowl In the early 19th century the elements carbon nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen were recognized as the primary components of food and methods to measure their proportions were developed In 1816 Fran√ßois Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates sugar fat olive oil and water died evidently of starvation but dogs also fed protein survived identifying protein as an essential dietary component William Prout in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into carbohydrates fat and protein During the 19th century JeanBaptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value In the 1860s Claude Bernard discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen In the early 1880s Kanehiro Takaki observed that Japanese sailors whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice developed beriberi or endemic neuritis a disease causing heart problems and paralysis but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of thiamine to the diet later understood as a cure In 1896 Eugen Baumann observed iodine in thyroid glands In 1897 Christiaan Eijkman worked with natives of Java who also suffered from beriberi Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice discovering that food can cure disease Over two decades later nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1 also known as thiamine From 1900 to the present  In the early 20th century Carl von Voit and Max Rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals applying principles of physics in nutrition In 1906 Edith G Willcock and Frederick Hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the wellbeing of mice but it did not assure their growth In the middle of twelve years of attempts to isolate them Hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that unsuspected dietetic factors other than calories protein and minerals are needed to prevent deficiency diseases In 1907 Stephen M Babcock and Edwin B Hart started the cow feeding singlegrain experiment which took nearly four years to complete  In 1912 Casimir Funk coined the term vitamin a vital factor in the diet from the words vital and amine because these unknown substances preventing scurvy beriberi and pellagra were thought then to be derived from ammonia The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century In 1913 Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis discovered the first vitamin fatsoluble vitamin A then watersoluble vitamin B in 1915 now known to be a complex of several watersoluble vitamins and named vitamin C as the thenunknown substance preventing scurvy Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B In 1919 Sir Edward Mellanby incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil In 1922 McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil but found that it still cured rickets Also in 1922 HM Evans and LS Bishop discover vitamin E as essential for rat pregnancy originally calling it food factor X until 1925 In 1925 Hart discovered that trace amounts of copper are necessary for iron absorption In 1927 Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus synthesized vitamin D and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928 In 1928 Albert SzentGy√∂rgyi isolated ascorbic acid and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy In 1935 he synthesized it and in 1937 he won a Nobel Prize for his efforts SzentGy√∂rgyi concurrently elucidated much of the citric acid cycle In the 1930s William Cumming Rose identified essential amino acids necessary protein components that the body cannot synthesize In 1935 Underwood and Marston independently discovered the necessity of cobalt In 1936 Eugene Floyd DuBois showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake In 1938 Erhard Fernholz discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E and then he tragically disappeared It was synthesised the same year by Paul Karrer In 1940 rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by Elsie Widdowson and others In 1941 the first Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs were established by the National Research Council In 1992 The US Department of Agriculture introduced the Food Guide Pyramid This replaced the Four Food Groups 19561992 and was superseded by the concept of MyPlate 2011present A 2014 metaanalysis concluded that adenovirus 36 Ad36 infection is associated with an increased risk of obesity development Nutrients  The list of nutrients that people are known to require is in the words of Marion Nestle almost certainly incomplete As of 2014 nutrients are thought to be of two types macronutrients which are needed in relatively large amounts and micronutrients which are needed in smaller quantities A type of carbohydrate dietary fiber ie nondigestible material such as cellulose is required for both mechanical and biochemical reasons although the exact reasons remain unclear Some nutrients can be stored  the fatsoluble vitamins  while others are required more or less continuously Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or for some vitamins and minerals too much of a required nutrient Macronutrients The macronutrients are carbohydrates fiber fats protein and water The macronutrients excluding fiber and water provide structural material amino acids from which proteins are built and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built and energy Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally and in either case it is measured in Joules or kilocalories often called Calories and written with a capital C to distinguish them from little c calories Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17\\xa0kJ approximately 4\\xa0kcal of energy per gram while fats provide 37\\xa0kJ 9\\xa0kcal per gram though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort which vary substantially from instance to instance Vitamins minerals fiber and water do not provide energy but are required for other reasons Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides glucose fructose and galactose to complex polysaccharides starch Fats are triglycerides made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone Some fatty acids but not all are essential in the diet they cannot be synthesized in the body Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon oxygen and hydrogen The fundamental components of protein are nitrogencontaining amino acids some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally Some of the amino acids are convertible with the expenditure of energy to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose in a process known as gluconeogenesis By breaking down existing protein the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to intermediates in cellular respiration the remaining ammonia is discarded primarily as urea in urine Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides disaccharides or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer sugar units they contain They constitute a large part of foods such as rice noodles bread and other grainbased products also potatoes yams beans fruits fruit juices and vegetables Monosaccharides disaccharides and polysaccharides contain one two and three or more sugar units respectively Polysaccharides are often referred to as complex carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple branched chains of sugar units Traditionally simple carbohydrates are believed to be absorbed quickly and therefore to raise bloodglucose levels more rapidly than complex carbohydrates This however is not accurate Some simple carbohydrates eg fructose follow different metabolic pathways eg fructolysis that result in only a partial catabolism to glucose while in essence many complex carbohydrates may be digested at the same rate as simple carbohydrates The World Health Organization WHO recommends that added sugars should represent no more than 10 of total energy intake Fiber  Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals Like all carbohydrates when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories kilocalories of energy per gram However in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it There are two subcategories soluble and insoluble fiber Whole grains fruits especially plums prunes and figs and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber There are many health benefits of a highfiber diet Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it Insoluble fiber found in whole wheat flour nuts and vegetables especially stimulates peristalsis‚Äì the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digest along the digestive tract Soluble fiber found in oats peas beans and many fruits dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar Additionally fiber perhaps especially that from whole grains is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain Fat  A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms bonded to a glycerol They are typically found as triglycerides three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms doublebonded so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated one doublebond or polyunsaturated many doublebonds Furthermore depending on the location of the doublebond in the fatty acid chain unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega3 or omega6 fatty acids Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with transisomer bonds these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources they are typically created in an industrial process called partial hydrogenation There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat Fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid catalpic acid eleostearic acid and punicic acid in addition to providing energy represent potent immune modulatory molecules Saturated fats typically from animal sources have been a staple in many world cultures for millennia Unsaturated fats e g vegetable oil are considered healthier while trans fats are to be avoided Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature such as butter or lard while unsaturated fats are typically liquids such as olive oil or flaxseed oil Trans fats are very rare in nature and have been shown to be highly detrimental to human health but have properties useful in the food processing industry such as rancidity resistance Essential fatty acids  Most fatty acids are nonessential meaning the body can produce them as needed generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so However in humans at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids‚Äîomega3 and omega6 fatty acids‚Äîseems also important for health although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive Both of these omega longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins which have roles throughout the human body They are hormones in some respects The omega3 eicosapentaenoic acid EPA which can be made in the human body from the omega3 essential fatty acid alphalinolenic acid ALA or taken in through marine food sources serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins eg weakly inflammatory PGE3 The omega6 dihomogammalinolenic acid DGLA serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins eg antiinflammatory PGE1 whereas arachidonic acid AA serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins eg proinflammatory PGE 2 Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega6 linoleic acid LA in the human body or can be taken in directly through food An appropriately balanced intake of omega3 and omega6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins which is one reason why a balance between omega3 and omega6 is believed important for cardiovascular health In industrialized societies people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega6 fatty acids relative to omega3 fatty acids The conversion rate of omega6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2 Omega3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from proinflammatory PGE2 made from AA toward antiinflammatory PGE1 made from DGLA Moreover the conversion desaturation of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta5desaturase which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin upregulation and glucagon downregulation The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed along with some types of amino acid can influence processes involving insulin glucagon and other hormones therefore the ratio of omega3 versus omega6 has wide effects on general health and specific effects on immune function and inflammation and mitosis ie cell division Protein   Proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body eg muscles skin and hair They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein such as the keratin in hair The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins protein retention and to replace damaged proteins maintenance As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision amino acids must be present in the diet Excess amino acids are discarded typically in the urine For all animals some amino acids are essential an animal cannot produce them internally and some are nonessential the animal can produce them from other nitrogencontaining compounds About twenty amino acids are found in the human body and about ten of these are essential and therefore must be included in the diet A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids especially those that are essential is particularly important in some situations during early development and maturation pregnancy lactation or injury a burn for instance A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids It is possible with protein combinations of two incomplete protein sources eg rice and beans to make a complete protein source and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions However complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be used together by the body Excess amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis Water   Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms including urine and feces sweating and by water vapour in the exhaled breath Therefore it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6‚Äì8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration However the notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods More recent comparisons of wellknown recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health Therefore to help standardize guidelines recommendations for water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority EFSA documents 2010 i Foodbased dietary guidelines and ii Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes ADI These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with ‚Äúdesirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per energy unit consumed‚Äù For healthful hydration the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water intakes of 20 Lday for adult females and 25 Lday for adult males These reference values include water from drinking water other beverages and from food About 80 of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we drink with the remaining 20 coming from food Water content varies depending on the type of food consumed with fruit and vegetables containing more than cereals for example These values are estimated using countryspecific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower energy consumption the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity Pregnant and breastfeeding women require additional fluids to stay hydrated The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as nonpregnant women plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement equal to 300 mLday To compensate for additional fluid output breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mLday above the recommended intake values for nonlactating women Dehydration and overhydration  too little and too much water respectively  can have harmful consequences Drinking too much water is one of the possible causes of hyponatremia ie low serum sodium Ethanol Pure ethanol provides 7 calories per gram For spirits vodka gin rum etc a standard serving in the United States is 15 fluid ounces which at 40 ethanol 80 proof would be 14 grams and 98 calories At 50 alcohol 175 grams and 1225 calories Wine and beer contain a similar range of ethanol for servings of 5 ounces and 12 ounces respectively but these beverages also contain nonethanol calories A 5 ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories A 12 ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories According to the US Department of Agriculture based on NHANES 20132014 surveys women ages 20 and up consume on average 68 gramsday and men consume on average 155 gramsday Ignoring the nonalcohol contribution of those beverages the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 calday Alcoholic beverages are considered empty calorie foods because other than calories these contribute no essential nutrients Micronutrients The micronutrients are minerals vitamins and others Minerals  Dietary minerals are inorganic chemical elements required by living organisms other than the four elements carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules The term mineral is archaic since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet Some are heavier than the four just mentioned including several metals which often occur as ions in the body Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally or at least as complex compounds or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells Some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources On the other hand minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements the most famous is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter Macrominerals Many elements are essential in relative quantity they are usually called bulk minerals Some are structural but many play a role as electrolytes Elements with recommended dietary allowance RDA greater than 150 \\xa0mgday are in alphabetical order with informal or folkmedicine perspectives in parentheses Calcium a common electrolyte but also needed structurally for muscle and digestive system health bone strength some forms neutralize acidity may help clear toxins provides signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions Chlorine as chloride ions very common electrolyte see sodium below Magnesium required for processing ATP and related reactions builds bone causes strong peristalsis increases flexibility increases alkalinity Phosphorus required component of bones essential for energy processing Potassium a very common electrolyte heart and nerve health Sodium a very common electrolyte in general not found in dietary supplements despite being needed in large quantities because the ion is very common in food typically as sodium chloride or common salt Excessive sodium consumption can deplete calcium and magnesium leading to high blood pressure and osteoporosis Sulfur for three essential amino acids and therefore many proteins skin hair nails liver and pancreas Sulfur is not consumed alone but in the form of sulfurcontaining amino acids Trace minerals Many elements are required in trace amounts usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes Some trace mineral elements RDA lt 200\\xa0mgday are in alphabetical order Cobalt required for biosynthesis of vitamin B12 family of coenzymes Animals cannot biosynthesize B12 and must obtain this cobaltcontaining vitamin in their diet Copper required component of many redox enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase   Chromium required for sugar metabolism Iodine required not only for the biosynthesis of thyroxine but also\\xa0‚Äî it is presumed\\xa0‚Äî for other important organs as breast stomach salivary glands thymus etc see Extrathyroidal iodine for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list and sometimes classified with the macrominerals Iron required for many enzymes and for hemoglobin and some other proteins Manganese processing of oxygen Molybdenum required for xanthine oxidase and related oxidases Selenium required for peroxidase antioxidant proteins Zinc required for several enzymes such as carboxypeptidase liver alcohol dehydrogenase and carbonic anhydrase Vitamins  Vitamins are essential nutrients necessary in the diet for good health Vitamin D is an exception as it can be synthesized in the skin in the presence of UVB radiation and many animal species can synthesize vitamin C Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions including goitre scurvy osteoporosis impaired immune system disorders of cell metabolism certain forms of cancer symptoms of premature aging and poor psychological health among many others Excess levels of some vitamins are also dangerous to health The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has established Tolerable Upper Intake Levels ULs for seven vitamins Phytochemicals   Phytochemicals such as polyphenols are compounds produced naturally in plants phyto means plant in Greek In general the term is used to refer to compounds which do not appear to be nutritionally essential and yet may have positive impacts on health To date there is no conclusive evidence in humans that polyphenols or other nonnutrient compounds from plants have health benefit effects Many of these substances from fruits berries nuts spices vegetables and whole grain foods are described as having antioxidant activity While initial studies sought to reveal if nutrient antioxidant supplements might promote health one metaanalysis concluded that supplementation with vitamins A and E and betacarotene did not convey any benefits and may in fact increase risk of death Vitamin C and selenium supplements did not impact mortality rate Health effects of nonnutrient phytochemicals such as polyphenols were not assessed in this review  Intestinal bacterial flora  Animal intestines contain a large population of gut flora In humans the four dominant phyla are Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria They are essential to digestion and are also affected by food that is consumed Bacteria in the large intestine perform many important functions for humans including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of soluble fiber stimulating cell growth repressing the growth of harmful bacteria training the immune system to respond only to pathogens producing vitamin B12 and defending against some infectious diseases Probiotics refers to the idea of deliberately consuming live bacteria in an attempt to change the bacterial population in the large intestine to the health benefit of the host human or animal Prebiotic nutrition refers to the idea that consuming a bacterial energy source such as soluble fiber could support the population of healthbeneficial bacteria in the large intestine There is not yet a scientific consensus as to health benefits accruing from probiotics or prebiotics Animal nutrition  Carnivore and herbivore diets are contrasting with basic nitrogen and carbon proportions vary for their particular foods Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize Plant nutrition  Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements that are necessary for plant growth There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition Some elements are directly involved in plant metabolism However this principle does not account for the socalled beneficial elements whose presence while not required has clear positive effects on plant growth A nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to Liebigs law of the minimum is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air and hydrogen which is obtained from water Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen through their leaves Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions H into the soil through proton pumps These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root In the leaves stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis Although nitrogen is plentiful in the Earths atmosphere very few plants can use this directly Most plants therefore require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a nitrogen fixation process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given clone Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high Furthermore deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element and vice versa Advice and guidance Government policies Canadas Food Guide is another example governmentrun nutrition program Produced by Health Canada the guide advises food quantities provides education on balanced nutrition and promotes physical activity in accordance with governmentmandated nutrient needs Like other nutrition programs around the world Canadas Food Guide divides nutrition into four main food groups vegetables and fruit grain products milk and alternatives and meat and alternatives It is interesting to note that unlike its American counterpart the Canadian guide references and provides alternative to meat and dairy which can be attributed to the growing vegan and vegetarian movements In the US nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of MyPlate which superseded the food pyramid which replaced the Four Food Groups The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry Committee Committee hearings are often televised on CSPAN The US Department of Health and Human Services provides a sample weeklong menu that fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government Government programs Governmental organisations have been working on nutrition literacy interventions in nonprimary health care settings to address the nutrition information problem in the US Some programs include The Family Nutrition Program FNP is a free nutrition education program serving lowincome adults around the US This program is funded by the Food Nutrition Service‚Äôs FNS branch of the United States Department of Agriculture USDA usually through a local state academic institution that runs the program The FNP has developed a series of tools to help families participating in the Food Stamp Program stretch their food dollar and form healthful eating habits including nutrition education Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program ENFEP is a unique program that currently operates in all 50 states and in American Samoa Guam Micronesia Northern Marianas Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands It is designed to assist limitedresource audiences in acquiring the knowledge skills attitudes and changed behavior necessary for nutritionally sound diets and to contribute to their personal development and the improvement of the total family diet and nutritional wellbeing An example of a state initiative to promote nutrition literacy is Smart Bodies a publicprivate partnership between the state‚Äôs largest university system and largest health insurer Louisiana State Agricultural Center and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation Launched in 2005 this program promotes lifelong healthful eating patterns and physically active lifestyles for children and their families It is an interactive educational program designed to help prevent childhood obesity through classroom activities that teach children healthful eating habits and physical exercise Education Nutrition is taught in schools in many countries In England and Wales the Personal and Social Education and Food Technology curricula include nutrition stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging In many schools a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments In some American schools students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes Nutrition is offered at many schools and if it is not a class of its own nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as Life Skills Independent Living Single Survival Freshmen Connection Health etc In many Nutrition classes students learn about the food groups the food pyramid Daily Recommended Allowances calories vitamins minerals malnutrition physical activity healthful food choices portion sizes and how to live a healthy life A 1985 US National Research Council report entitled Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate Only 20 of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate required course A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30 Membership by physicians in leading professional nutrition societies such as the American Society for Nutrition has generally declined from the 1990s Professional organizations In the US Registered dietitian nutritionists RDs or RDNs are health professionals qualified to provide safe evidencebased dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten a thorough review of nutritional health and a personalized nutritional treatment plan They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places schools and similar institutions Certified Clinical Nutritionists or CCNs are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs Government regulation especially in terms of licensing is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease In order to become board certified potential CNS candidate must pass an examination much like Registered Dieticians This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including Clinical Intervention and Human Health Nutrition literacy The findings of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy NAAL provide a basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the US NAAL introduced the first ever measure of the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\\xa0‚Äì an objective of Healthy People 2010 and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an important subset On a scale of below basic basic intermediate and proficient NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health literacy 44 have intermediate literacy 29 percent have basic literacy and 14 percent have below basic health literacy The study found that health literacy increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have lower health literacy than those above it Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high likelihood of limited literacy skills While a precise comparison between the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult primarily because of methodological differences Zoellner et al suggest that health literacy rates in the Mississippi Delta region are different from the US general population and that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among adults in the Delta region For example only 12 percent of study participants identified the My Pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the USDA The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment further delineating priorities for the region These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of healthnutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems Among these problems are the lack of information about food choices a lack of understanding of nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances limited or difficult access to healthful foods and a range of cultural influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and living The links between low health literacy and poor health outcomes has been widely documented and there is evidence that some interventions to improve health literacy have produced successful results in the primary care setting More must be done to further our understanding of nutrition literacy specific interventions in nonprimary care settings in order to achieve better health outcomes Malnutrition  Malnutrition refers to insufficient excessive or imbalanced consumption of nutrients by an organism In developed countries the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption In developing countries malnutrition is more likely to be caused by poor access to a range of nutritious foods or inadequate knowledge In Mali the International Crops Research Institute for the SemiArid Tropics ICRISAT and the Aga Khan Foundation trained womens groups to make equinut a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe did√®gu√® comprising peanut paste honey and millet or rice flour The aim was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could make and sell and which would be accepted by the local community because of its local heritage Although under and overnutrition are often viewed as human problems pet animals can be under or overfed by their owners domesticated animals can be undernourished for macro and micronutrients affecting growth and health and wild animals can be undernourished to the point of starvation and death Nutritionism is the view that excessive reliance on food science and the study of nutrition can lead to poor nutrition and to ill health It was originally credited to Gyorgy Scrinis and was popularized by Michael Pollan Since nutrients are invisible policy makers rely on nutrition experts to advise on food choices Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body Pollan argues nutritionism can be blamed for many of the health problems relating to diet in the Western World today Insufficient The US Food and Nutrition Board sets Estimated Average Requirements EARs and Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs for vitamins and minerals EARs and RDAs are part of Dietary Reference Intakes The DRI documents describe nutrient deficiency signs and symptoms Excessive The US Food and Nutrition Board sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels known as ULs for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient ULs are set a safe fraction below amounts shown to cause health problems ULs are part of Dietary Reference Intakes The European Food Safety Authority also reviews the same safety questions and set its own ULs Unbalanced When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion of the proper amount of other nutrients the diet is said to be unbalanced High calorie food ingredients such as vegetable oils sugar and alcohol are referred to as empty calories because they displace from the diet foods that also contain protein vitamins minerals and fiber Illnesses caused by improper nutrient consumption Mental agility  Research indicates that improving the awareness of nutritious meal choices and establishing longterm habits of healthy eating have a positive effect on cognitive and spatial memory capacity with potential to increase a students ability to process and retain academic information Some organizations have begun working with teachers policymakers and managed foodservice contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university level institutions Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success Currently less than 10 of American college students report that they eat the recommended five servings of fruit and vegetables daily Better nutrition has been shown to affect both cognitive and spatial memory performance a study showed those with higher blood sugar levels performed better on certain memory tests In another study those who consumed yogurt performed better on thinking tasks when compared to those that consumed caffeinefree diet soda or confections Nutritional deficiencies have been shown to have a negative effect on learning behavior in mice as far back as 1951 Better learning performance is associated with dietinduced effects on learning and memory ability The nutritionlearning nexus demonstrates the correlation between diet and learning and has application in a higher education setting We find that betternourished children perform significantly better in school partly because they enter school earlier and thus have more time to learn but mostly because of greater learning productivity per year of schooling 91 of college students feel that they are in good health whereas only 7 eat their recommended daily allowance of fruits and vegetables Nutritional education is an effective and workable model in a higher education setting More engaged learning models that encompass nutrition is an idea that is picking up steam at all levels of the learning cycle There is limited research available that directly links a students Grade Point Average GPA to their overall nutritional health Additional substantive data is needed to prove that overall intellectual health is closely linked to a persons diet rather than just another correlation fallacy Mental disorders Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder the four most common mental disorders in developed countries Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid each of which an omega3 fatty acid contained in fish oil but not in flaxseed oil vitamin B12 folic acid and inositol Cancer Cancer is now common in developing countries According to a study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer In the developing world cancers of the liver stomach and esophagus were more common often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods such as smoked or salted food and parasitic infections that attack organs Developed countries tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a Western lifestyle\\xa0‚Äî cancers of the colon rectum breast and prostate\\xa0‚Äî that can be caused by obesity lack of exercise diet and age Metabolic syndrome Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyleinduced hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin function ie insulin resistance as a decisive factor in many disease states For example hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microtrauma and clot formation ie heart disease and exaggerated cell division ie cancer Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance the socalled metabolic syndrome are characterized by a combination of abdominal obesity elevated blood sugar elevated blood pressure elevated blood triglycerides and reduced HDL cholesterol The negative effect of hyperinsulinemia on prostaglandin PGE1PGE2 balance may be significant The state of obesity clearly contributes to insulin resistance which in turn can cause type 2 diabetes Virtually all obese and most type 2 diabetic individuals have marked insulin resistance Although the association between overweight and insulin resistance is clear the exact likely multifarious causes of insulin resistance remain less clear It is important to note that it has been demonstrated that appropriate exercise more regular food intake and reducing glycemic load see below all can reverse insulin resistance in overweight individuals and thereby lower their blood sugar level in those with type 2 diabetes Obesity can unfavorably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone leptin and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulinleptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another The vicious cycle is putatively fueled by continuously high insulinleptin stimulation and fat storage as a result of high intake of strongly insulinleptin stimulating foods and energy Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the hypothalamus in the brain however insulinleptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores In addition reduced leptin signaling to the brain may reduce leptins normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors‚Äî such as intake of processed carbohydrates total protein fat and carbohydrate intake intake of saturated and trans fatty acids and low intake of vitaminsminerals‚Äîcontribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance In any case analogous to the way modern manmade pollution may possess the potential to overwhelm the environments ability to maintain homeostasis the recent explosive introduction of high glycemic index and processed foods into the human diet may possess the potential to overwhelm the bodys ability to maintain homeostasis and health as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic Antinutrient  Antinutrients are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere with the absorption of nutrients Nutrition studies focus on antinutrients commonly found in food sources and beverages Sugar consumption in the United States The relatively recent increased consumption of sugar has been linked to the rise of some afflictions such as diabetes obesity and more recently heart disease Increased consumption of sugar has been tied to these three among others Obesity levels have more than doubled in the last 30 years among adults going from 15 to 35 in the United States Obesity and diet also happen to be high risk factors for diabetes In the same time span that obesity doubled diabetes numbers quadrupled in America Increased weight especially in the form of belly fat and high sugar intake are also high risk factors for heart disease Both sugar intake and fatty tissue increase the probability of elevated LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream Elevated amounts of Lowdensity lipoprotein LDL cholesterol is the primary factor in heart disease In order to avoid all the dangers of sugar moderate consumption is paramount Processed foods  Since the Industrial Revolution some two hundred years ago the food processing industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled These latter technologies include pasteurisation autoclavation drying salting and separation of various components all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food Pasteurisation and autoclavation heating techniques have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods preventing epidemics of bacterial infection But some of the new food processing technologies have downfalls as well Modern separation techniques such as milling centrifugation and pressing have enabled concentration of particular components of food yielding flour oils juices and so on and even separate fatty acids amino acids vitamins and minerals Inevitably such largescale concentration changes the nutritional content of food saving certain nutrients while removing others Heating techniques may also reduce foods content of many heatlabile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals and possibly other yettobediscovered substances Because of reduced nutritional value processed foods are often enriched or fortified with some of the most critical nutrients usually certain vitamins that were lost during processing Nonetheless processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole fresh foods regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches potassiumsodium vitamins fiber and of intact unoxidized essential fatty acids In addition processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a populations health is the history of epidemics of beriberi in people subsisting on polished rice Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin thiamine causing beriberi Another example is the development of scurvy among infants in the late 19th century in the United States It turned out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heattreated as suggested by Pasteur to control bacterial disease Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria but it destroyed the vitamin C As mentioned lifestyle and obesityrelated diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy and as such it is influential in political decisions eg nutritional recommendations agricultural subsidising In any known profitdriven economy health considerations are hardly a priority effective production of cheap foods with a long shelflife is more the trend In general whole fresh foods have a relatively short shelflife and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods Thus the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive but nutritionally superior whole fresh foods and cheap usually nutritionally inferior processed foods Because processed foods are often cheaper more convenient in both purchasing storage and preparation and more available the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutritionrelated health complications See also    Notes and references  Bibliography Carpenter Kenneth J 1994 Protein and Energy A Study of Changing Ideas in Nutrition

       "  'raw page text': 'The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the United States largest organization of food and nutrition professionals and represents over 100000 credentialed practitioners ‚Äî registered dietitian nutritionists dietetic technicians registered and other dietetics professionals holding undergraduate and advanced degrees in nutrition and dietetics After nearly 100 years as the American Dietetic Association the organization officially changed its name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2012 The organizations members are primarily registered dietitian nutritionists RDNs and nutrition and dietetic technicians registered NDTR as well as many researchers educators students nurses physicians pharmacists clinical and community dietetics professionals consultants and food service managers The Academy has faced controversy regarding corporate influence related to its relationship with the food industry and funding from corporate groups such as McDonalds CocaCola Mars and others    Origins The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics was founded in 1917 in Cleveland Ohio by a group of women led by Lenna F Cooper and the Academys first president Lulu G Graves who were dedicated to helping the government conserve food and improve public health during World War I It is now headquartered in Chicago Illinois The original mission of the Academy was in part to help make maximal use of Americas food resources during wartime In its first year the Academy attracted 58 members It remained a small organization remaining under the 1000 member mark until the 1930s As the groups scope expanded so did its membership numbers Between the 1930s and 1960s membership skyrocketed to more than 60000 Growth trajectory has since stabilized and the Academy marked its 70000th member when a female dietitian in Texas rejoined the Academy in May 2009 Since its founding in 1917 the Academy has gained members in every decade  An authorized seal for the organization was adopted by the Executive Board and presented to members on October 24 1940 At its center are symbols of the three main characteristics of the profession a balance scale representing science as the foundation and symbolizing equality a caduceus representing the close relationship between dietetics and medicine and a cooking vessel representing cookery and food preparation Around the main design is a shaft of wheat representing bread the staff of life and stylized acanthus leaves representing growth and life Over the design is a cornucopia representing an abundant food supply Beneath the design is the motto Quam Plurimis Prodesse To benefit as many as possible Around the edge is the name of the organization and the date of its founding written in Roman numerals The seal is still in use on Registration Status Certificates for both registered dietitians and dietetic technicians registered as well as on the gold Member Pin According to current Academy president Sylvia Escott Stump the group changed their name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2012 to reflect the scientific and academic expertise of its members National Nutrition Month In 1973 the Academy created ‚ÄúNational Nutrition Week‚Äù The theme the first year was Invest in YourselfBuy Nutrition‚Äù On May 9 2010 the Academy proclaimed ‚ÄúRegistered Dietitians Day‚Äù to honor the ‚Äúindispensable providers of food and nutrition services and to recognize RDs for their commitment to helping people enjoy healthy lives‚Äù The association also sponsors ‚ÄúNational Nutrition Month‚Äù in March in the US Finances and Organization In 2015 the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics had disclosed net assets of 48 million the bulk of which was in cash and investments It took in 113M in annual membership dues and an additional 74M in registration and examination fees In 2015 it took in 352 million in revenue on expenses of 384M for an operating loss of 34M After accounting for return on investments the Academy posted a deficit of 544722 for the 2015 fiscal year In the same year they received 11 million in corporate sponsorships from companies like General Mills CocaCola and PepsiCo via donations joint initiatives and programs The Academy has offices both in Chicago and Washington DC In addition to the Academy the organization maintains several other organizations and entities including the Commission on Dietetic Registration Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education Dietetic Practice Groups Academy Political Action Committee and Academy Foundation There are also several ‚Äúmember interest groups‚Äù which include more than 4800 members with common interests or specialties including Fifty Plus in Nutrition and Dietetics Filipino Americans in Dietetics and Nutrition Muslims in Dietetics and Nutrition and National Organization of Blacks in Dietetics and Nutrition Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation In 1966 the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics established the Foundation as a 501C3 public charity According to its mission statement the Foundation is the ‚Äúonly charitable organization devoted exclusively to promoting good nutrition‚Äù Its mission is to advance public health and nutrition with focus on three initiatives scholarships Healthy Weight for Kids and food and nutrition research In 2011 the Foundation had charitable contributions and revenues of 423 million of which 17 million went to program expenses 540000 went to administrative expenses and 289000 went to fund raising expenses Its executive director Mary Beth Whalen is paid 215000 per year These figures earned the Foundation a 609570 score by CharityNavigatorcom four stars for transparency three stars for its financials In 2011 the Foundation received corporate contributions totaling around 12 million from organizations such as Nestle Kelloggs Mars Inc CocaCola and the National Cattlemens Beef Association as well as a 500000 donation industrial food giant General Mills to promote healthy eating for kids Influence and positions Through its research journal the Academy shapes and influences the public and legislative discussion about health food safety and nutrition Academy RDs are regularly quoted in world publications such as New York Times Wall Street Journal USA Today Los Angeles Times Mens Fitness O Magazine Consumer Reports Forbes and Huffington Post In 2010 the organization received approximately 30 billion media impressions As an organization and research institute the Academy holds a variety of influential health positions including The Academy maintains that the only way to lose weight is through a healthy wellbalanced diet and exercise The Academys stated position is that ‚Äúthere are no good or bad foods only good and bad diets‚Äù According to the Academy such labeling or ‚Äúbumpers‚Äù confuse the public The Academy states that exclusive breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition and health protection for the first 6 months of life and breastfeeding with complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age is the ideal feeding pattern for infants The Academy believes that up to two servings of soy per day for adults could be part of a healthy diet The Academy has stated that a well planned vegan diet no meat dairy or animal products is appropriate and healthy for babies The Academy states that to combat the obesity epidemic adults and children need access to healthy foods education on eating well and preventative health services including counseling by registered dietitian nutritionists They support the White House and Michelle Obamas efforts to end the childhood obesity epidemic within a generation The Academy opposed mandated labeling of trans fats on food packaging The Academy has given low ratings to the highprotein lowcarb diet known as the Atkins Diet insisting that the diet is unhealthy and the weight loss is temporary The Academy maintains that carbohydrates are not responsible for weight gain any more than other forms of calories The Academy states that children who eat breakfast have better concentration problemsolving skills and eye hand coordination Children who do not eat breakfast are tired at school and eat more junk food Research and Publications The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics publishes position papers on public health regarding pediatric childrens health food technology food safety geriatrics elderly health healthcare reform obesity and food and nutrition topics through the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics ANDJ The Academy has also published 3 editions of the American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide Through its publishing arm the Academy has published such books and guides as Easy GlutenFree ADA Pocket Guide to Eating Disorders ADA Pocket Guide to Lipid Disorders Hypertension Diabetes and Weight Management ADA Quick Guide to DrugSupplement Interactions and Making Nutrition Your Business It also maintains the site eatrightorg In the 1980s the Academy published the magazine Food2 which had originally been created by the US Department of Agriculture In response pressure from meat egg and dairy industries the Department of Agriculture decided not publish it after which the Academy negotiated with the government to publish it itself omitting the controversial chapters on fat and cholesterol The decision was widely criticized with participating dietitians stating it is just incredible that they would publish it without the most important part Certification The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics certification process offers two career options Registered Dietitian Nutritionist RDN and Nutrition and Dietetics Technician Registered NDTR Both are educated nutrition professionals qualified to work in hospitals academia and private practice and differ mostly in the hours of training and level of college degree required A Registered Dietitian Nutritionist must complete a bachelors degree or higher and more than 900 hours of training while a Dietetic Technician is required to complete and associate level degree and 450 hours of training About 72 of the Academys members are Registered Dietitian Nutritionists and 2 are Nutrition Dietetic Technicians Registered Members are granted these accredited titles by fulfilling the Academys strenuous certification requirements in addition to any state or local regulations Through its ADAF foundation the Academy issued nearly 500000 in certification scholarships in 2011 100000 of which went to doctoral students The terms ‚ÄúRegistered Dietitian Nutritionist‚Äù and ‚ÄúNutrition Dietetic Technician Registered‚Äù are ‚Äúlegally protected titles‚Äù and can be used only by someone who has completed coursework approved by the Academy In recent years the AND has lobbied for stricter regulation over the professional licensing of dietitian and nutrition professionals and supported state regulations that would include heavy fines for the dispensing of nutritional advice without the proper license The Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticss Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics ACEND is the organizations accrediting agency for education programs that prepare individuals for careers as dietetics professionals Prior to 2011 ACEND was known as the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education CADE The Accreditation Council is recognized by the Department of Education and is a member of the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors The councils fees earn the Academy over 1 million per year Registered Dietitian Nutritionist RDN According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist is a ‚Äúfood and nutrition expert‚Äù who has fulfilled the minimum requirements for the titled RD Requirements include the following items Earning a bachelors degree with course work approved by the Academyss Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics ACEND Coursework typically includes food and nutrition sciences foodservice systems management business economics computer science sociology biochemistry physiology microbiology and chemistry Completing an accredited supervised practice program at a healthcare facility community agency or foodservice corporation Passing a national examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration Completing continuing professional educational requirements to maintain registration In addition to the costs of the college coursework the Academy charges a 200 application fee for registered dietitians Students must complete a 1200 hour internship to sit for the Registered Dietitian exam Approximately 50 of RDs hold advanced degrees Some RDNs also hold additional certifications in specialized areas of practice such as pediatric or renal nutrition nutrition support and diabetes education In addition to any Academy requirements and often with some overlap many states have laws for dietitians and nutrition practitioners Nutrition Dietetic Technician Registered NDTR According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics NDTRs are ‚Äúa food and nutrition practitioner‚Äù who has fulfilled the minimum requirements for the title NDTR These requirements while similar to an RD differ in that they require A minimum of an Associates degree At least 450 hours of supervised practice accredited by ACEND Successful pass a national DTR examination administered by CDR Complete continuing professional educational requirements to maintain registration NDTRs typically work closely with RD in numerous employment settings such as hospitals health care facilities private practice day care centers correctional facilities and weight loss centers The Academy application fee to become an NDTR is 120 Lobbying efforts and competitive protections To help better communications with the US government the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has offices in Washington DC They also operate their own political action committee the Academys Political Action Committee The Academy spent 58 million lobbying at the state and national level from 2000‚Äì2010 A 1985 report noted the Academy has supported licensing for dispensing nutritional advice In addition to supporting legislation regulating the professional nutrition field in states like Colorado Wyoming Hawaii New Jersey and New York the Academy has also applied for patents for its certification titles such as ‚ÄúCertified Nutrition Coach‚Äù ‚ÄúCertified Nutrition Professional‚Äù ‚ÄúRegistered Nutrition Professional‚Äù and ‚ÄúCertified Nutrition Educator‚Äù The Academy states that by regulating who can provide nutritional counseling they can protect their registered members and the public from unregulated advice or possibly inaccurate advice from less qualified dietary practitioners such as chiropractors yoga instructors homeopaths and personal trainers The Academys support of this legislation has generated strong opposition from alternative health practitioners and libertarian groups who state that highly restrictive bills could create a monopoly for one school of traditional nutrition thought and that the primary intent of the bill is not to protect the public but to give clout and recognition to a single segment of dietitians increasing their chances of obtaining reimbursement from insurance companies Kids Eat Right The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the ADA Foundation launched their first joint initiative Kids Eat Right in November 2010 This memberdriven campaign is dedicated to supporting the efforts of the White House to end the childhood obesity epidemic within a generation Kids Eat Right is a twotiered campaign aimed to mobilize Academy members to participate in community and school childhood obesity prevention efforts and also to educate families communities and policy makers about the importance of quality nutrition Kids Eat Right has a website that gives families healthy eating tips articles videos and recipes from registered dietitians Kids Eat Right also has scientificallybased health information centered around the theme ShopCookEat which has information about how to shop for healthy foods how to cook foods with the most nutrient value and gives the benefits of eating together at home and away from home Controversy The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has been criticized for its connections to the pharmaceutical industry including an inquiry from Senator Chuck Grassley In 1982 the organization faced mass resignations from members over a decision to support President Ronald Reagans cuts in food stamps and school lunch programs The decision was largely a political tradeoff the Reagan administration agreed to drop its proposal to deregulate nursing homes in exchange for the Academys support of the school lunch and food stamp cuts Criticism of partnerships with food companies A 1995 report noted the Academy received funding from companies like McDonalds PepsiCo The CocaCola Company Sara Lee Abbott Nutrition General Mills Kelloggs Mars McNeil Nutritionals SOYJOY Truvia Unilever and The Sugar Association as corporate sponsorship The Academy also partners with ConAgra Foods which produces Orville Redenbacker Slim Jims Hunts Ketchup SnackPacks and Hebrew National hot dogs to maintain the American Dietetic AssociationConAgra Foods Home Food SafetyIts in Your Hands program Additionally the Academy earns revenue from corporations by selling space at its booth during conventions doing this for soft drinks and candy makers In April 2013 a dietitian working on a panel charged with setting policy on genetically modified foods for the academy contended she was removed for pointing out that two of its members had ties to Monsanto one of the biggest makers of genetically modified seeds The resulting controversy highlighted the fact that Ms Smith Edge chairwoman of the committee charged with developing the GMO policy is a senior vice president at the International Food Information Council which is largely financed by food beverage and agriculture businesses including companies like DuPont Bayer CropScience and Cargill companies that were among the biggest financial opponents of a State of California GMO labeling initiative The Academy maintains that being at the same table with food companies is important in order to exert a positive influence over their products and message although critics describe this as an ‚Äúunhealthy alliance‚Äù between the Academy and junk food companies The accusation is that despite what good may come of such programs it ultimately whitewashes similar to the greenwashing efforts of environmentally irresponsible companies the brands role in the countrys food ecosystem Watchdogs note that the Academy rarely criticizes food companies believing it to be out of fear of biting the hand that feeds them Nutrition expert Marion Nestle opined that she believed that as long as the AND partners with the makers of food and beverage products ‚Äúits opinions about diet and health will never be believed to be independent‚Äù Public health lawyer Michele Simon who researches and writes about the food industry and food politics has voiced similar concerns stating AND is deeply embedded with the food industry and often communicates messaging that is industry friendly A 2011 survey found that 80 of Academy members are critical of the Academys position They believe that the Academy is endorsing corporate sponsors and their products when it allows their sponsorship In March 2015 Academy had endorsed Kraft Singles cheese product with the Kids Eat Right label Due to negative publicity they entered into negotiations with Kraft to cancel this endorsement The organization also publishes nutrition facts sheets for the general public which food companies pay 20000 to take part in writing the documents A list of these publications for the general public include Whats a Mom to Do Healthy Eating Tips for Families sponsored by Wendys Lamb The Essence of Nutrient Rich Flavor sponsored by the TriLamb Group Cocoa and Chocolate Sweet News sponsored by the Hershey Center for Health and Nutrition Eggs A Good Choice for MomstoBe sponsored by the American Egg Board Adult Beverage Consumption Making Responsible Drinking Choices sponsored by the Distilled Spirits Council This industry funding also gives food companies the ability to offer official educational seminars to teach dietitians how to advise their clients in a way that advances the interests of the food company For instance in a CocaCola sponsored seminar for dietitians the speaker promoted free sugars consumption for children as a healthy choice Additional publications The Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics JAND formerly titled the Journal of the American

       "  'raw page text': 'Animal nutrition focuses on the dietary needs of animals primarily those in agriculture and food production but also in zoos aquariums and wildlife management There are seven major classes of nutrients carbohydrates fats fibre minerals proteins vitamins and water The macronutrients excluding fiber and water provide structural material amino acids from which proteins are built and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built and energy Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally and in either case it is measured in joules or calories sometimes called kilocalories and on other rare occasions written with a capital C to distinguish them from little c calories Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17\\xa0kJ approximately 4\\xa0kcal of energy per gram while fats provide 37\\xa0kJ 9\\xa0kcal per gram though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort which vary substantially from instance to instance Vitamins minerals fiber and water do not provide energy but are required for other reasons A third class dietary material fiber ie nondigestible material such as cellulose seems also to be required for both mechanical and biochemical reasons though the exact reasons remain unclear Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides glucose fructose galactose to complex polysaccharides starch Fats are triglycerides made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to glycerol backbone Some fatty acids but not all are essential in the diet they cannot be synthesized in the body Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon oxygen and hydrogen The fundamental components of protein are nitrogencontaining amino acids some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally Some of the amino acids are convertible with the expenditure of energy to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose By breaking down existing protein some glucose can be produced internally the remaining amino acids are discarded primarily as urea in urine This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation Other dietary substances found in plant foods phytochemicals polyphenols are not identified as essential nutrients but appear to impact health in both positive and negative ways Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient classes together with other substances Some nutrients can be stored internally eg the fat soluble vitamins while others are required more or less continuously Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or in extreme cases too much of a required nutrient For example both salt provides sodium and chloride both essential nutrients but will cause illness or even death in too large amounts    Heterotrophs and autotrophs Autotrophs Those organisms which can make food on their own from simple substances are known as autotrophs This is because green plants chlorophyll and can perform photosynthesis In other words green plants have autotrophic mode of nutrition Heterotrophs The organisms which cannot make food themselves by the process of photosynthesis and take food from green plants or animals are called heterotrophs All nongreen plants do not have chlorophyll for carrying the process of photosynthesis So they depend other organisms for obtaining food Fat  A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms bonded to a glycerol They are typically found as triglycerides three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms doublebonded so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated one doublebond or polyunsaturated many doublebonds Furthermore depending on the location of the doublebond in the fatty acid chain unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega3 or omega6 fatty acids Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with transisomer bonds these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources they are typically created in an industrial process called partial hydrogenation Many studies have shown that unsaturated fats particularly monounsaturated fats are best in the human diet Saturated fats typically from animal sources are next while trans fats are to be avoided Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature such as butter or lard while unsaturated fats are typically liquids such as olive oil or flaxseed oil Trans fats are very rare in nature but have properties useful in the food processing industry such as rancid resistance Essential fatty acids  Most fatty acids are nonessential meaning the body can produce them as needed generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so However in humans at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids ‚Äî omega3 and omega6 fatty acids ‚Äî seems also important for health though definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive Both of these omega longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins which have roles throughout the human body They are hormones in some respects The omega3 eicosapentaenoic acid EPA which can be made in the human body from the omega3 essential fatty acid alphalinolenic acid LNA or taken in through marine food sources serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins eg weakly inflammatory PGE3 The omega6 dihomogammalinolenic acid DGLA serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins eg antiinflammatory PGE1 whereas arachidonic acid AA serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins eg proinflammatory PGE 2 Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega6 linoleic acid LA in the human body or can be taken in directly through food An appropriately balanced intake of omega3 and omega6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins one reason a balance between omega3 and omega6 is believed important for cardiovascular health In industrialized societies people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega6 fatty acids relative to omega3 fatty acids The conversion rate of omega6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2 Omega3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from proinflammatory PGE2 made from AA toward antiinflammatory PGE1 made from DGLA Moreover the conversion desaturation of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta5desaturase which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin upregulation and glucagon downregulation The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed along with some types of amino acid can influence processes involving insulin glucagon and other hormones therefore the ratio of omega3 versus omega6 has wide effects on general health and specific effects on immune function and inflammation and mitosis ie cell division Good sources of essential fatty acids include most vegetables nuts seeds and marine oils Some of the best sources are fish flax seed oils soy beans pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds and walnuts Fiber  Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate polysaccharide or oligosaccharide that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals Like all carbohydrates when it is metabolized it can produce four calories kilocalories of energy per gram But in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible because humans do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it There are two subcategories soluble and insoluble fibre Whole grains fruits especially plums prunes and figs and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber Fiber is important to digestive health and is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer For mechanical reasons it can help in alleviating both constipation and diarrhea Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents and insoluble fiber especially stimulates peristalsis‚Äîthe rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high viscosity this is essentially a gel which slows the movement of food through the intestines Additionally fiber perhaps especially that from whole grains may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes Protein   Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures eg muscles skin and hair They also form the enyzmes which control chemical reactions throughout the body Each molecule is composed of amino acids which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein such as the keratin in hair The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins protein retention and to replace damaged proteins maintenance As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision amino acids must be present in the diet Excess amino acids are discarded typically in the urine For all animals some amino acids are essential an animal cannot produce them internally and some are nonessential the animal can produce them from other nitrogencontaining compounds About twenty amino acids are found in the human body and about ten of these are essential and therefore must be included in the diet A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids especially those that are essential is particularly important in some situations during early development and maturation pregnancy lactation or injury a burn for instance A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids It is possible to combine two incomplete protein sources eg rice and beans to make a complete protein source and characteristic combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions Sources of dietary protein include meats tofu and other soyproducts eggs grains legumes and dairy products such as milk and cheese A few amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis this is done in quantity only during starvation The amino acids remaining after such conversion are discarded Minerals  Dietary minerals are the chemical elements required by living organisms other than the four elements carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules The term mineral is archaic since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet Some are heavier than the four just mentioned‚Äîincluding several metals which often occur as ions in the body Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally or at least as complex compounds or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources On the other hand minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements the most famous is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter Macrominerals Many elements are essential in relative quantity they are usually called bulk minerals Some are structural but many play a role as electrolytes Elements with recommended dietary allowance RDA greater than 200\\xa0mgday are in alphabetical order with informal or folkmedicine perspectives in parentheses Calcium a common electrolyte but also needed structurally structural for muscle and digestive system health bones some forms neutralizes acidity may help clear toxins and provide signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions Chlorine as chloride ions very common electrolyte see sodium below Magnesium required for processing ATP and related reactions builds bone causes strong peristalsis increases flexibility increases alkalinity Phosphorus required component of bones essential for energy processing Potassium a very common electrolyte heart and nerve health Sodium a very common electrolyte not generally found in dietary supplements despite being needed in large quantities because the ion is very common in food typically as sodium chloride or common salt Sulfur for three essential amino acids and therefore many proteins skin hair nails liver and pancreas Trace minerals Many elements are required in trace amounts usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes Some trace mineral elements RDA lt 200\\xa0mgday are in alphabetical order Cobalt required for biosynthesis of vitamin B12 family of coenzymes Copper required component of many redox enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase Chromium required for sugar metabolism Iodine required not only for the biosynthesis of thyroxin but probably for other important organs as breast stomach salivary glands thymus etc see Extrathyroidal iodine for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list and sometimes classified with the macrominerals Iron required for many enzymes and for hemoglobin and some other proteins Manganese processing of oxygen Molybdenum required for xanthine oxidase and related oxidases Nickel present in urease Selenium required for peroxidase antioxidant proteins Vanadium Speculative there is no established RDA for vanadium No specific biochemical function has been identified for it in humans although vanadium is required for some lower organisms Zinc required for several enzymes such as carboxypeptidase liver alcohol dehydrogenase carbonic anhydrase Vitamins  As with the minerals discussed above some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients necessary in the diet for good health Vitamin D is the exception it can alternatively be synthesized in the skin in the presence of UVB radiation Certain vitaminlike compounds that are recommended in the diet such as carnitine are thought useful for survival and health but these are not essential dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds Moreover thousands of different phytochemicals have recently been discovered in food particularly in fresh vegetables which may have desirable properties including antioxidant activity see below experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include essential amino acids see above choline essential fatty acids see above and the minerals discussed in the preceding section Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions goitre scurvy osteoporosis impaired immune system disorders of cell metabolism certain forms of cancer symptoms of premature aging and poor psychological health including eating disorders among many others Excess of some vitamins is also dangerous to health notably vitamin A and animal nutrition researchers have managed to establish safe levels for some common companion animals For at least one vitamin B6 toxicity begins at levels not far above the required amount Deficiency or excess of minerals can also have serious health consequences Water   About 70 of the nonfat mass of the human body is made of water Analysis of Adipose Tissue in Relation to Body Weight Loss in Man Retrieved from Journal of Applied To function properly the body requires between one and seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration the precise amount depends on the level of activity temperature humidity and other factors With physical exertion and heat exposure water loss increases and daily fluid needs will eventually increase as well It is not fully clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people although some experts assert that 8‚Äì10 glasses of water approximately 2 liters daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration The notion that a person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source The effect of greater or lesser water intake on weight loss and on constipation is also still unclear The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods The latest dietary reference intake report by the United States National Research Council recommended generally including food sources 27 liters of water total for women and 37 liters for men Specifically pregnant and breastfeeding women need additional fluids to stay hydrated According to the Institute of Medicine‚Äîwho recommend that on average women consume 22 litres and men 30 litres‚Äîthis is recommended to be 24 litres approx 9 cups for pregnant women and 3 litres approx 125 cups for breastfeeding women since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising however putting them at risk of water intoxication which can be fatal In particular large amounts of deionized water are dangerous Normally about 20 percent of water intake comes in food while the rest comes from drinking water and assorted beverages caffeinated included Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms including urine and feces sweating and by water vapor in the exhaled breath Other nutrients Other micronutrients include antioxidants and phytochemicals These substances are generally more recent discoveries which have not yet been recognized as vitamins or as required Phytochemicals may act as antioxidants but not all phytochemicals are antioxidants Antioxidants  Antioxidants are a recent discovery As cellular metabolismenergy production requires oxygen potentially damaging eg mutation causing compounds known as free radicals can form Most of these are oxidizers ie acceptors of electrons and some react very strongly For normal cellular maintenance growth and division these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors glutathione Vitamin C and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources Vitamin C in humans Vitamin A Vitamin K or produced by the body from other compounds Betacarotene converted to Vitamin A by the body Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight Phytochemicals Section Below and their subgroup polyphenols are the majority of antioxidants about 4000 are known Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network eg vitamin C can reactivate free radicalcontaining glutathione or vitamin E by accepting the free radical itself and so on Some antioxidants are more effective than others at neutralizing different free radicals Some cannot neutralize certain free radicals Some cannot be present in certain areas of free radical development Vitamin A is fatsoluble and protects fat areas Vitamin C is water soluble and protects those areas When interacting with a free radical some antioxidants produce a different free radical compound that is less dangerous or more dangerous than the previous compound Having a variety of antioxidants allows any byproducts to be safely dealt with by more efficient antioxidants in neutralizing a free radicals butterfly effect Phytochemicals   A growing area of interest is the effect upon human health of trace chemicals collectively called phytochemicals These nutrients are typically found in edible plants especially colorful fruits and vegetables but also other organisms including seafood algae and fungi The effects of phytochemicals increasingly survive rigorous testing by prominent health organizations One of the principal classes of phytochemicals are polyphenol antioxidants chemicals which are known to provide certain health benefits to the cardiovascular system and immune system These chemicals are known to downregulate the formation of reactive oxygen species key chemicals in cardiovascular disease Perhaps the most rigorously tested phytochemical is zeaxanthin a yellowpigmented carotenoid present in many yellow and orange fruits and vegetables Repeated studies have shown a strong correlation between ingestion of zeaxanthin and the prevention and treatment of agerelated macular degeneration AMD Less rigorous studies have proposed a correlation between zeaxanthin intake and cataracts A second carotenoid lutein has also been shown to lower the risk of contracting AMD Both compounds have been observed to collect in the retina when ingested orally and they serve to protect the rods and cones against the destructive effects of light Another carotenoid betacryptoxanthin appears to protect against chronic joint inflammatory diseases such as arthritis While the association between serum blood levels of betacryptoxanthin and substantially decreased joint disease has been established neither a convincing mechanism for such protection nor a causeandeffect have been rigorously studied Similarly a red phytochemical lycopene has substantial credible evidence of negative association with development of prostate cancer The correlations between the ingestion of some phytochemicals and the prevention of disease are in some cases enormous in magnitude Even when the evidence is obtained translating it to practical dietary advice can be difficult and counterintuitive Lutein for example occurs in many yellow and orange fruits and vegetables and protects the eyes against various diseases However it does not protect the eye nearly as well as zeaxanthin and the presence of lutein in the retina will prevent zeaxanthin uptake Additionally evidence has shown that the lutein present in egg yolk is more readily absorbed than the lutein from vegetable sources possibly because of fat solubility At the most basic level the question should you eat eggs is complex to the point of dismay including misperceptions about the health effects of cholesterol in egg yolk and its saturated fat content As another example lycopene is prevalent in tomatoes and actually is the chemical that gives tomatoes their red color It is more highly concentrated however in processed tomato products such as commercial pasta sauce or tomato soup than in fresh healthy tomatoes Yet such sauces tend to have high amounts of salt sugar other substances a person may wish or even need to avoid The following table presents phytochemical groups and common sources arranged by family  Ash Though not really a nutrient as such an entry for ash is sometimes found on nutrition labels especially for pet food This entry measures the weight of inorganic material left over after the food is burned for two hours at 600\\xa0¬∞C Thus it does not include water fibre and nutrients that provide calories but it does include some nutrients such as minerals  There have been some concerns that too much ash may contribute to feline urological syndrome in domestic cats Intestinal bacterial flora  It is now also known that animal intestines contain a large population of gut flora In humans these include species such as Bacteroides L acidophilus and E coli among many others They are essential to digestion and are also affected by the food we eat Bacteria in the gut perform many important functions for humans including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of otherwise indigestible food stimulating cell growth repressing the growth of harmful bacteria training the immune system to respond only to pathogens producing vitamin B12 and defending against some infectious diseases See also Human nutrition Animal nutritionist References  External links Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes CIRB International Livestock Research Institute

heat of combustion of proteins fats and carbohydrates These vary slightly depending on sources and Atwater derived weighted values for the gross heat of combustion of the protein fat and carbohydrate in the typical mixed diet of his time It has been argued that these weighted values are invalid for individual foods and for diets whose composition in terms of foodstuffs is different from those eaten in the USA in the early 20th century Apparent digestibility coefficients Atwater measured a large number of digestibility coefficients for simple mixtures and in substitution experiments derived values for individual foods These he combined in a weighted fashion to derive values for mixed diets When these were tested experimentally with mixed diets they did not give a good prediction and Atwater adjusted the coefficients for mixed diets Urinary correction The energynitrogen ratio in urine shows considerable variation and the energyorganic matter is less variable but the energynitrogen value provided Atwater with a workable approach although this has caused some confusion and only applies for subjects in nitrogen balance Modified system Based on the work of Atwater it became common practice to calculate energy content of foods using 4 kcalg for carbohydrates and proteins and 9 kcalg for lipids The system was later improved by Annabel Merrill and Bernice Watt of the USDA who derived a system whereby specific calorie conversion factors for different foods were proposed This takes cognizance of the fact that first the gross energy values of the protein fats and carbohydrates from different food sources are different and second that the apparent digestibility of the components of different foods is different This system relies on having measured heats of combustion of a wide range of isolated proteins fats and carbohydrates It also depends on data from digestibility studies where individual foods have been substituted for basal diets in order to measure the apparent digestibility coefficients for those foods This approach is based on the assumption that there are no interactions between foods in a mixture in the intestine and from a practical view point such studies with humans are difficult to control with the required accuracy Assumptions based on the use of carbohydrates by difference and the effects of dietary fibre The carbohydrate by difference approach presents several problems First it does not distinguish between sugars starch and the unavailable carbohydrates roughage or dietary fibre This affects first the gross energy that is assigned to carbohydrate‚Äîsucrose has a heat of combustion of 395\\xa0kcalg 1653\\xa0kJg and starch 415\\xa0kcalg 1736\\xa0kJg Secondly it does not provide for the fact that sugars and starch are virtually completely digested and absorbed and thus provide metabolisable energy equivalent to their heat of combustion The unavailable carbohydrates dietary fibre are degraded to a variable extent in the large bowel The products of this microbial digestion are fatty acids CO2 carbon dioxide methane and hydrogen The fatty acids acetate butyrate and propionate are absorbed in the large intestine and provide some metabolisable energy The extent of degradation depends on the source of the dietary fibre its composition and state of division and the individual consuming the dietary fibre There is insufficient data to give firm guidance on the energy available from this source Finally dietary fibre affects faecal losses of nitrogen and fat Whether the increased fat loss is due to an effect on small intestinal absorption is not clear The increased faecal nitrogen losses on high fibre diets are probably due to an increased bacterial nitrogen content of the faeces Both these effects however lead to reductions in apparent digestibility and therefore the Atwater system warrants small changes in the proper energy conversion factors for those diets Theoretical and practical considerations relating to the calculation of energy values Variations in heats of combustion of food constituents Proteins The experimental evidence for the magnitude of this variation is very limited but as the heats of combustion of the individual aminoacids are different it is reasonable to expect variations between different proteins An observed range of from 548 for conglutin from blue lupin to 592 for Hordein barley was reported which compares with Atwaters‚Äô range of 527 for gelatin to 595 for wheat gluten It is difficult to calculate expected values for a protein from aminoacid data as some of the heats of combustion are not known accurately Preliminary calculations on cows milk suggest a value of around 55 kcalg 230 kJg Fats Analogously the experimental evidence is limited but since the fatty acids differ in their heats of combustion one should expect fats to vary in heats of combustion These differences are however relatively small ‚Äì for example breast milk fat has a calculated heat of combustion of 937 kcalg 392 kJg compared with that of cow milk fat of 919 kcalg 385 kJg Carbohydrates Monosaccharides have heats of combustion of around 375 kcalg 157 kJg disaccharides 395 kcalg 165 kJg and polysaccharides 415 to 420 kcalg 174 to 176 kJg The heat of hydrolysis is very small and these values are essentially equivalent when calculated on a monosaccharide basis Thus 100 g sucrose gives on hydrolysis 1056 g monosaccharide and 100 g starch gives on hydrolysis 110 g glucose Apparent digestibility coefficients The human digestive tract is a very efficient organ and the faecal excretion of nitrogenous material and fats is a small proportion usually less than 10 of the intake Atwater recognised that the faecal excretion was a complex mixture of unabsorbed intestinal secretions bacterial material and metabolites sloughed mucosal cells mucus and only to a small extent unabsorbed dietary components This might be one reason why he chose to use availability rather than digestibility His view was that these faecal constituents were truly unavailable and that his apparent disregard of the nature of faecal excretion was justifiable in a practical context The ratio                                                                                 intake                              ‚àí                                faecal excretion                                         intake                                              displaystyle frac textintaketextfaecal excretiontextintake    wherever faecal excretion is small will approximate to unity and thus these coefficients have a low variance and have the appearance of constants This is spurious since faecal excretion is variable even on a constant diet and there is no evidence to suggest that faecal excretion is in fact related to intake in the way implied by these coefficients Practical considerations in calculations of energy value of foods and diets The calculation of energy values must be regarded as an alternative to direct measurement and therefore is likely to be associated with some inaccuracy when compared with direct assessment These inaccuracies arise for a number of reasons Variations in food composition Foods are biological mixtures and as such show considerable variation in composition particularly in respect of water and fat content This means that compositional values quoted for representative samples of foods in food composition tables do not necessarily apply to individual samples of foods In studies where great accuracy is required samples of the food consumed must be analysed Measurements of food intake In estimating energy intakes measurements of food intake are made and these are known to be subject to considerable uncertainty Even in studies under very close supervision the errors in weighing individual food items are rarely less than ¬±5 A certain degree of pragmatism must therefore be used when assessing procedures for calculating energy intakes and many authors impute greater accuracy to quoted calculated energy intakes than is justifiable Individual variation Variations in individuals are seen in all human studies and these variations are not allowed for in most calculations The theoretical and physiological objections to the assumptions inherent in the Atwater system are likely to result in errors much smaller than these practical matters Conversion factors were derived from experimental studies with young infants but these produced values for metabolisable energy intake that were insignificantly different from those obtained by direct application of the modified Atwater factors See also Food energy CalorimetryCalorimeter References  Further reading US Department of Agriculture ‚Äì Agricultural Research

       "  'raw page text': 'Biological value BV is a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organisms body It captures how readily the digested protein can be used in protein synthesis in the cells of the organism Proteins are the major source of nitrogen in food BV assumes protein is the only source of nitrogen and measures the proportion of this nitrogen absorbed by the body which is then excreted The remainder must have been incorporated into the proteins of the organisms body A ratio of nitrogen incorporated into the body over nitrogen absorbed gives a measure of protein usability ‚Äì the BV Unlike some measures of protein usability biological value does not take into account how readily the protein can be digested and absorbed largely by the small intestine This is reflected in the experimental methods used to determine BV BV uses two similar scales The true percentage utilization usually shown with a percent symbol The percentage utilization relative to a readily utilizable protein source often egg usually shown as unitless These two values will be similar but not identical The BV of a food varies greatly and depends on a wide variety of factors In particular the BV value of a food varies depending on its preparation and the recent diet of the organism This makes reliable determination of BV difficult and of limited use ‚Äî fasting prior to testing is universally required in order to ascertain reliable figures BV is commonly used in nutrition science in many mammalian organisms and is a relevant measure in humans It is a popular guideline in bodybuilding in protein choice    Determination of BV For accurate determination of BV the test organism must only consume the protein or mixture of proteins of interest the test diet the test diet must contain no nonprotein sources of nitrogen the test diet must be of suitable content and quantity to avoid use of the protein primarily as an energy source These conditions mean the tests are typically carried out over the course of over one week with strict diet control Fasting prior to testing helps produce consistency between subjects it removes recent diet as a variable There are two scales on which BV is measured percentage utilization and relative utilization By convention percentage BV has a percent sign  suffix and relative BV has no unit Percentage utilization Biological value is determined based on this formula BV   Nr  Na   100 Where Na  nitrogen absorbed in proteins on the test diet Nr  nitrogen incorporated into the body on the test diet However direct measurement of Nr is essentially impossible It will typically be measured indirectly from nitrogen excretion in urine Faecal excretion of nitrogen must also be taken into account  this part of the ingested protein is not absorbed by the body and so not included in the calculation of BV An estimate is used of the amount of the urinary and faecal nitrogen excretion not coming from ingested nitrogen This may be done by substituting a proteinfree diet and observing nitrogen excretion in urine or faeces but the accuracy of this method of estimation of the amount of nitrogen excretion not coming from ingested nitrogen on a proteincontaining diet has been questioned BV    Ni  Nef  Neu   Ni  Nef   100 Where Ni  nitrogen intake in proteins on the test diet Nef  nitrogen excreted in faeces whilst on the test diet  nitrogen excreted in faeces not from ingested nitrogen Neu  nitrogen excreted in urine whilst on the test diet  nitrogen excreted in urine not from ingested nitrogen Note Nr  Ni  Nef  Neu Na  Ni  Nef This can take any value from 0 to 100 though reported BV could be out of this range if the estimates of nitrogen excretion from noningested sources are inaccurate such as could happen if the endogenous secretion changes with protein intake A BV of 100 indicates complete utilization of a dietary protein ie 100 of the protein ingested and absorbed is incorporated into proteins into the body The value of 100 is an absolute maximum no more than 100 of the protein ingested can be utilized in the equation above Neu and Nef cannot go negative setting 100 as the maximum BV Relative utilization Due to experimental limitations BV is often measured relative to an easily utilizable protein Normally egg protein is assumed to be the most readily utilizable protein and given a BV of 100 For example Two tests of BV are carried out on the same person one with the test protein source and one with a reference protein egg protein relative BV   BVtest  BVegg   100 Where BVtest  percentage BV of the test diet for that individual BVegg  percentage BV of the reference egg diet for that individual This is not restricted to values of less than 100 The percentage BV of egg protein is only 937 which allows other proteins with true percentage BV between 937 and 100 to take a relative BV of over 100 For example whey protein takes a relative BV of 104 while its percentage BV is under 100 The principal advantage of measuring BV relative to another protein diet is accuracy it helps account for some of the metabolic variability between individuals In a simplistic sense the egg diet is testing the maximum efficiency the individual can take up protein the BV is then provided as a percentage taking this as the maximum Conversion Providing it is known which protein measurements were made relative to it is simple to convert from relative BV to percentage BV BVrelative   BVpercentage  BVreference   100 BVpercentage   BVrelative  100   BVreference Where BVrelative  relative BV of the test protein BVreference  percentage BV of reference protein typically egg 937 BVpercentage  percentage BV of the test protein While this conversion is simple it is not strictly valid due to the differences between the experimental methods It is however suitable for use as a guideline Factors that affect BV The determination of BV is carefully designed to accurately measure some aspects of protein usage whilst eliminating variation from other aspects When using the test or considering BV values care must be taken to ensure the variable of interest is quantified by BV Factors which affect BV can be grouped into properties of the protein source and properties of the species or individual consuming the protein Properties of the protein source Three major properties of a protein source affect its BV Amino acid composition and the limiting amino acid which is usually lysine Preparation cooking Vitamin and mineral content Amino acid composition is the principal effect All proteins are made up of combinations of the 21 biological amino acids Some of these can be synthesised or converted in the body whereas others cannot and must be ingested in the diet These are known as essential amino acids EAAs of which there are 9 in humans The number of EAAs varies according to species see below EAAs missing from the diet prevent the synthesis of proteins that require them If a protein source is missing critical EAAs then its biological value will be low as the missing EAAs form a bottleneck in protein synthesis For example if a hypothetical muscle protein requires phenylalanine an essential amino acid then this must be provided in the diet for the muscle protein to be produced If the current protein source in the diet has no phenylalanine in it the muscle protein cannot be produced giving a low usability and BV of the protein source In a related way if amino acids are missing from the protein source which are particularly slow or energy consuming to synthesise this can result in a low BV Methods of food preparation also affect the availability of amino acids in a food source Some of food preparation may damage or destroy some EAAs reducing the BV of the protein source Many vitamins and minerals are vital for the correct function of cells in the test organism If critical minerals or vitamins are missing from the protein source this can result in a massively lowered BV Many BV tests artificially add vitamins and minerals for example in yeast extract to prevent this Properties of the test species or individual Under test conditions Variations in BV under test conditions are dominated by the metabolism of the individuals or species being tested In particular differences in the essential amino acids EAAs species to species has a significant effect although even minor variations in amino acid metabolism individual to individual have a large effect The fine dependence on the individuals metabolism makes measurement of BV a vital tool in diagnosing some metabolic diseases In everyday life The principal effect on BV in everyday life is the organisms current diet although many other factors such as age health weight sex etc all have an effect In short any condition which can affect the organisms metabolism will vary the BV of a protein source In particular whilst on a high protein diet the BV of all foods consumed is reduced ‚Äî the limiting rate at which the amino acids may be incorporated into the body is not the availability of amino acids but the rate of protein synthesis possible in cells This is a major point of criticism of BV as a test the test diet is artificially protein rich and may have unusual effects Factors with no effect BV is designed to ignore variation in digestibility of a food ‚Äî which in turn largely depends on the food preparation For example compare raw soy beans and extracted soy bean protein The raw soy beans with tough cell walls protecting the protein have a far lower digestibility than the purified unprotected soy bean protein extract As a foodstuff far more protein can be absorbed from the extract than the raw beans however the BV will be the same The exclusion of digestibility is a point of misunderstanding and leads to misrepresentation of the meaning of a high or low BV Advantages and disadvantages BV provides a good measure of the usability of proteins in a diet and also plays a valuable role in detection of some metabolic diseases BV is however a scientific variable determined under very strict and unnatural conditions It is not a test designed to evaluate the usability of proteins whilst an organism is in everyday life ‚Äî indeed the BV of a diet will vary greatly depending on age weight health sex recent diet current metabolism etc of the organism In addition BV of the same food varies significantly species to species Given these limitations BV is still relevant to everyday diet to some extent No matter the individual or their conditions a protein source with high BV such as egg will always be more easily used than a protein source with low BV In comparison to other methods known There are many other major methods of determining how readily used a protein is including Net protein Utilization NPU Protein Efficiency Ratio PER Nitrogen Balance NB Protein digestibility PD Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score PDCAAS These all hold specific advantages and disadvantages over BV although in the past BV has been held in high regard In animals The Biological Value method is also used for analysis in animals such as cattle poultry and various laboratory animals such as rats It was used by the poultry industry to determine which mixtures of feed were utilized most efficiently by developing chicken Although the process remains the same the biological values of particular proteins in humans differs from their biological values in animals due to physiological variations Typical values Common foodstuffs and their values Note this scale uses 100 as 100 of the nitrogen incorporated Whey Protein 96  Whole Soy Bean 96  Human milk 95 Chicken egg 94 Soybean milk 91 Buckwheat 90 Cow milk 90 Cheese 84 Quinoa 83 Rice 83 Defatted soy flour 81 Fish 76 Beef 743 Immature bean 65 Fullfat soy flour 64 Soybean curd tofu 64 Whole wheat 64 White flour 41 Common foodstuffs and their values Note These values use whole egg as a value of 100 so foodstuffs that provide even more nitrogen than whole eggs can have a value of more than 100 100 does not mean that 100 of the nitrogen in the food is incorporated into the body and not excreted as in other charts Whey protein concentrate 104 Whole egg 100 Cow milk 91 Beef 80 Casein 77 Soy 74 Wheat gluten 64 Criticism Since the method measures only the amount that is retained in the body critics have pointed out what they perceive as a weakness of the biological value methodology Critics have pointed to research that indicates that because whey protein isolate is digested so quickly it may in fact enter the bloodstream and be converted into carbohydrates through a process called gluconeogenesis much more rapidly than was previously thought possible so while amino acid concentrations increased with whey it was discovered that oxidation rates also increased and a steadystate metabolism a process where there is no change in overall protein balance is created They claim that when the human body consumes whey protein it is absorbed so rapidly that most of it is sent to the liver for oxidation Hence they believe the reason so much is retained is that it is used for energy production not protein synthesis This would bring into question whether the method defines which proteins are more biologically utilizable A further critique published in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine states that the BV of a protein does not take into consideration several key factors that influence the digestion and interaction of protein with other foods before absorption and that it only measures a proteins maximal potential quality and not its estimate at requirement levels Also the study by Poullain et al which is often cited to demonstrate the superiority of whey protein hydrolysate by marketers measured nitrogen balance in rats after three days of starvation which corresponds to a longer period in humans The study found that whey protein hydrolysate led to better nitrogen retention and growth than the other proteins studied However the studys flaw is in the BV method used as starvation affects how well the body will store incoming protein as does a very high caloric intake leading to falsely elevated BV measures So the BV of a protein is related to the amount of protein given BV is measured at levels below the maintenance level This means that as protein intake goes up the BV of that protein goes down For example milk protein shows a BV near 100 at intakes of 02 gkg As protein intake increases to roughly maintenance levels 05 gkg BV drops only around 70 Pellet et al concluded that biological measures of protein quality conducted at suboptimal levels in either experimental animals or human subjects may overestimate protein value at maintenance levels As a result while BV may be important for rating proteins where intake is below requirements it has little bearing on individuals with protein intakes far above requirements This flaw is supported by the FAOWHOUNU who state that BV and NPU are measured when the protein content of the diet is clearly below that of requirement deliberately done to maximize existing differences in quality as inadequate energy intake lowers the efficiency of protein utilization and in most N balance studies calorie adequacy is ensured And because no population derives all of its protein exclusively from a single food the determination of BV of a single protein is of limited use for application to human protein requirements Another limitation of the use of Biological Value as a measure of protein quality is that proteins which are completely devoid of one essential amino acid EAA can still have a BV of up to 40 This is because of the ability of organisms to conserve and recycle EAAs as an adaptation of inadequate intake of the amino acid Lastly the use of rats for the determination of protein quality is not ideal Rats differ from humans in requirements of essential amino acids This has led to a general criticism that experiments on rats lead to an overestimation of the BV of highquality proteins to man because human requirements of essential amino acids are much lower than those for rats as rats grow at a much faster rate than humans Also because of their fur rats are assumed to have relatively high requirements of sulphurcontaining amino acids methionine and cysteine As a result the analytical method that is universally recognized by the Food and

       "  'raw page text': 'Blood lipids or blood fats are lipids in the blood either free or bound to other molecules They are mostly transported in a protein capsule and the density of the lipids and type of protein determines the fate of the particle and its influence on metabolism The concentration of blood lipids depends on intake and excretion from the intestine and uptake and secretion from cells Blood lipids are mainly fatty acids and cholesterol Hyperlipidemia is the presence of elevated or abnormal levels of lipids andor lipoproteins in the blood and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease    Fatty acids Intestine intake  Short and medium chain fatty acids are absorbed directly into the blood via intestine capillaries and travel through the portal vein Longchain fatty acids on the other hand are too large to be directly released into the tiny intestine capillaries Instead they are coated with cholesterol and protein protein coat of lipoproteins into a compound called a chylomicron The chylomicron enters a lymphatic capillary and enters into the bloodstream first at the left subclavian vein having bypassed the liver In any case the concentration of blood fatty acids increase temporarily after a meal Cell uptake After a meal when the blood concentration of fatty acids rises there is an increase in uptake of fatty acids in different cells of the body mainly liver cells adipocytes and muscle cells This uptake is stimulated by insulin from the pancreas As a result the blood concentration of fatty acid stabilizes again after a meal Cell secretion After a meal some of the fatty acids taken up by the liver is converted into very low density lipoproteins VLDL and again secreted into the blood In addition when a long time has passed since the last meal the concentration of fatty acids in the blood decreases which triggers adipocytes to release stored fatty acids into the blood as free fatty acids in order to supply eg muscle cells with energy In any case also the fatty acids secreted from cells are anew taken up by other cells in the body until entering fatty acid metabolism Cholesterol  The fate of cholesterol in the blood is highly determined by its constitution of lipoproteins where some types favour transport towards body tissues and others towards the liver for excretion into the intestines The 1987 report of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panels suggest the total blood cholesterol level should be lt200\\xa0mgdl normal blood cholesterol 200‚Äì239\\xa0mgdl borderlinehigh gt240\\xa0mgdl high cholesterol The average amount of blood cholesterol varies with age typically rising gradually until one is about 60 years old There appear to be seasonal variations in cholesterol levels in humans more on average in winter These seasonal variations seem to be inversely linked to vitamin C intake Intestine intake  In lipid digestion cholesterol is packed into Chylomicrons in the small intestine which are delivered to the Portal vein and Lymph The chylomicrons are ultimately taken up by liver hepatocytes via interaction between apolipoproteinE and the LDL receptor or Lipoprotein receptorrelated proteins In lipoproteins  Cholesterol is minimally soluble in water it cannot dissolve and travel in the waterbased bloodstream Instead it is transported in the bloodstream by lipoproteins that are watersoluble and carry cholesterol and triglycerides internally The apolipoproteins forming the surface of the given lipoprotein particle determine from what cells cholesterol will be removed and to where it will be supplied The largest lipoproteins which primarily transport fats from the intestinal mucosa to the liver are called chylomicrons They carry mostly fats in the form of triglycerides In the liver chylomicron particles release triglycerides and some cholesterol The liver converts unburned food metabolites into very low density lipoproteins VLDL and secretes them into plasma where they are converted to intermediate density lipoproteinsIDL which thereafter are converted to lowdensity lipoprotein LDL particles and nonesterified fatty acids which can affect other body cells In healthy individuals the relatively few LDL particles are large In contrast large numbers of small dense LDL sdLDL particles are strongly associated with the presence of atheromatous disease within the arteries For this reason LDL is referred to as bad cholesterol Highdensity lipoprotein HDL particles transport cholesterol back to the liver for excretion but vary considerably in their effectiveness for doing this Having large numbers of large HDL particles correlates with better health outcomes and hence it is commonly called good cholesterol In contrast having small amounts of large HDL particles is independently associated with atheromatous disease progression within the arteries Intestine excretion After being transported to the liver by HDL cholesterol is delivered to the intestines via bile production However 9297 is reabsorbed in the intestines and recycled via enterohepatic circulation Cell uptake  Cholesterol circulates in the blood in lowdensity lipoproteins and these are taken into the cell by LDL receptormediated endocytosis in clathrincoated pits and then hydrolysed in lysosomes Cell secretion  In response to low blood cholesterol different cells of the body mainly in the liver and intestines start to synthesize cholesterol from acetylCoA by the enzyme HMGCoA reductase This is then released into the blood Related medical conditions Hyperlipidemia  Hyperlipidemia is the presence of elevated or abnormal levels of lipids andor lipoproteins in the blood Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are extremely common in the general population and are regarded as a highly modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease In addition some forms may predispose to acute pancreatitis One of the most clinically relevant lipid substances is cholesterol especially on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease The presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood is called hypercholesterolemia Hyperlipoproteinemia is elevated levels of lipoproteins Hypercholesterolemia  Hypercholesterolemia is the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood It is not a disease but a metabolic derangement that can be secondary to many diseases and can contribute to many forms of disease most notably cardiovascular disease Familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare genetic disorder that can occur in families where sufferers cannot properly metabolise cholesterol Hypocholesterolemia Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed hypocholesterolemia Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited and while some studies suggest a link with depression cancer and cerebral hemorrhage it is unclear whether the low cholesterol levels are a cause for these conditions or an epiphenomenon 1 See also

       "  'raw page text': 'The body fat percentage BFP of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat Essential body fat is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions The percentage of essential body fat for women is greater than that for men due to the demands of childbearing and other hormonal functions The percentage of essential fat is 2‚Äì5 in men and 10‚Äì13 in women referenced through NASM Storage body fat consists of fat accumulation in adipose tissue part of which protects internal organs in the chest and abdomen The minimum recommended total body fat percentage exceeds the essential fat percentage value reported above A number of methods are available for determining body fat percentage such as measurement with calipers or through the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis The body fat percentage is a measure of fitness level since it is the only body measurement which directly calculates a persons relative body composition without regard to height or weight The widely used body mass index BMI provides a measure that allows the comparison of the adiposity of individuals of different heights and weights While BMI largely increases as adiposity increases due to differences in body composition other indicators of body fat give more accurate results for example individuals with greater muscle mass or larger bones will have higher BMIs As such BMI is a useful indicator of overall fitness for a large group of people but a poor tool for determining the health of an individual    Typical body fat amounts Epidemiologically the percentage of body fat in an individual varies according to sex and age Various theoretical approaches exist on the relationships between body fat percentage health athletic capacity etc Different authorities have consequently developed different recommendations for ideal body fat percentages This graph from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States charts the average body fat percentages of Americans from samples from 1999‚Äì2004 In males mean percentage body fat ranged from 229 at age 16‚Äì19 years to 309 at age 60‚Äì79 years In females mean percentage body fat ranged from 320 at age 8‚Äì11 years to 424 at age 60‚Äì79 years The table below from the American Council on Exercise shows how average percentages differ according to the specified groups and categories Essential fat is the level at which physical and physiological health would be negatively affected and below which death is certain Controversy exists as to whether a particular body fat percentage is better for ones health athletic performance may also be affected The leanest athletes typically compete at levels of about 713 for men or 14‚Äì20 for women normal people who dont have a so great muscular mass should stay into the fitness range in the table to be healthier Bodybuilders may compete at essential body fat range in fact certified personal trainers will suggest them to keep that extremely low level of body fat only for the contest time However it is unclear that such levels are ever actually attained since a the means to measure such levels are as noted below lacking in principle and inaccurate and b 4‚Äì6 is generally considered a physiological minimum for human males Measurement techniques Underwater weighing  Irrespective of the location from which they are obtained the fat cells in humans are composed almost entirely of pure triglycerides with an average density of about 09\\xa0kilograms per litre Most modern body composition laboratories today use the value of 11 kilograms per litre for the density of the ‚Äúfat free mass‚Äù a theoretical tissue composed of 72 water density  0993 21 protein density  1340 and 7 mineral density  3000 by weight With a well engineered weighing system body density can be determined with great accuracy by completely submerging a person in water and calculating the volume of the displaced water from the weight of the displaced water A correction is made for the buoyancy of air in the lungs and other gases in the body spaces If there were no errors whatsoever in measuring body density the uncertainty in fat estimation would be about ¬± 38 of the body weight primarily because of normal variability in body constituents Wholebody air displacement plethysmography   Wholebody air displacement plethysmography ADP is a recognised and scientifically validated densitometric method to measure human body fat percentage ADP uses the same principles as the goldstandard method of underwater weighing but representing a densitometric method that is based on air displacement rather than on water immersion Airdisplacement plethysmography offers several advantages over established reference methods including a quick comfortable automated noninvasive and safe measurement process and accommodation of various subject types eg children obese elderly and disabled persons However its accuracy declines at the extremes of body fat percentages tending to slightly understate the percent body fat in overweight and obese persons by 168‚Äì294 depending on the method of calculation and to overstate to a much larger degree the percent body fat in very lean subjects by an average of 68 with up to a 13 overstatement of the reported body percentage of one individual ‚Äî ie 2 body fat by DXA but 15 by ADP Nearinfrared interactance A beam of infrared light is transmitted into a biceps The light is reflected from the underlying muscle and absorbed by the fat The method is safe noninvasive rapid and easy to use Dual energy Xray absorptiometry  Dual energy Xray absorptiometry or DXA formerly DEXA is a newer method for estimating body fat percentage and determining body composition and bone mineral density Xrays of two different energies are used to scan the body one of which is absorbed more strongly by fat than the other A computer can subtract one image from the other and the difference indicates the amount of fat relative to other tissues at each point A sum over the entire image enables calculation of the overall body composition Expansions There are several more complicated procedures that more accurately determine body fat percentage Some referred to as multicompartment models can include DXA measurement of bone plus independent measures of body water using the dilution principle with isotopically labeled water and body volume either by water displacement or air plethysmography Various other components may be independently measured such as total body potassium Invivo neutron activation can quantify all the elements of the body and use mathematical relations among the measured elements in the different components of the body fat water protein etc to develop simultaneous equations to estimate total body composition including body fat Body average density measurement Prior to the adoption of DXA the most accurate method of estimating body fat percentage was to measure that persons average density total mass divided by total volume and apply a formula to convert that to body fat percentage Since fat tissue has a lower density than muscles and bones it is possible to estimate the fat content This estimate is distorted by the fact that muscles and bones have different densities for a person with a morethanaverage amount of bone mass the estimate will be too low However this method gives highly reproducible results for individual persons ¬± 1 unlike the methods discussed below which can have an uncertainty of 10 or more The body fat percentage is commonly calculated from one of two formulas œÅ represents density in gcm3 Brozek formula BF  457œÅ ‚àí 4142 √ó 100 Siri formula is BF  495œÅ ‚àí 450 √ó 100 Bioelectrical impedance analysis  The bioelectrical impedance analysis BIA method is a lowercost from less than one to several hundred US dollars in 2006 but less accurate way to estimate body fat percentage The general principle behind BIA two or more conductors are attached to a persons body and a small electric current is sent through the body The resistance between the conductors will provide a measure of body fat between a pair of electrodes since the resistance to electricity varies between adipose muscular and skeletal tissue Fatfree mass muscle is a good conductor as it contains a large amount of water approximately 73 and electrolytes while fat is anhydrous and a poor conductor of electric current Factors that affect the accuracy and precision of this method include instrumentation subject factors technician skill and the prediction equation formulated to estimate the fatfree mass Each bare foot may be placed on an electrode with the current sent up one leg across the abdomen and down the other leg For convenience an instrument which must be stepped on will also measure weight Alternatively an electrode may be held in each hand calculation of fat percentage uses the weight so that must be measured with scales and entered by the user The two methods may give different percentages without being inconsistent as they measure fat in different parts of the body More sophisticated instruments for domestic use are available with electrodes for both feet and hands There is little scope for technician error as such but factors such as eating drinking and exercising must be controlled since hydration level is an important source of error in determining the flow of the electric current to estimate body fat The instructions for use of instruments typically recommended not making measurements soon after drinking or eating or exercising or when dehydrated Instruments require details such as sex and age to be entered and use formulae taking these into account for example men and women store fat differently around the abdomen and thigh region Different BIA analysers may vary For instance when comparing outputs from a Tanita scale to an Omron Body Logic handheld device the Tanita scale estimated a 40 higher percentage body fat in collegeaged men and a 55 higher percentage in collegeaged women when compared to hydrostatic weighing Populationspecific equations are available for some instruments making them more reliable Anthropometric methods There exist various anthropometric methods for estimating body fat The term anthropometric refers to measurements made of various parameters of the human body such as circumferences of various body parts or thicknesses of skinfolds Most of these methods are based on a statistical model Some measurements are selected and are applied to a population sample For each individual in the sample the methods measurements are recorded and that individuals body density is also recorded being determined by for instance underwater weighing in combination with a multicompartment body density model From this data a formula relating the body measurements to density is developed Because most anthropometric formulas such as the DurninWomersley skinfold method the JacksonPollock skinfold method and the US Navy circumference method actually estimate body density not body fat percentage the body fat percentage is obtained by applying a second formula such as the Siri or Brozek described in the above section on density Consequently the body fat percentage calculated from skin folds or other anthropometric methods carries the cumulative error from the application of two separate statistical models These methods are therefore inferior to a direct measurement of body density and the application of just one formula to estimate body fat percentage One way to regard these methods is that they trade accuracy for convenience since it is much more convenient to take a few body measurements than to submerge individuals in water The chief problem with all statistically derived formulas is that in order to be widely applicable they must be based on a broad sample of individuals Yet that breadth makes them inherently inaccurate The ideal statistical estimation method for an individual is based on a sample of similar individuals For instance a skinfold based body density formula developed from a sample of male collegiate rowers is likely to be much more accurate for estimating the body density of a male collegiate rower than a method developed using a sample of the general population because the sample is narrowed down by age sex physical fitness level type of sport and lifestyle factors On the other hand such a formula is unsuitable for general use  Skinfold methods The skinfold estimation methods are based on a skinfold test also known as a pinch test whereby a pinch of skin is precisely measured by calipers at several standardized points on the body to determine the subcutaneous fat layer thickness These measurements are converted to an estimated body fat percentage by an equation Some formulas require as few as three measurements others as many as seven The accuracy of these estimates is more dependent on a persons unique body fat distribution than on the number of sites measured As well it is of utmost importance to test in a precise location with a fixed pressure Although it may not give an accurate reading of real body fat percentage it is a reliable measure of body composition change over a period of time provided the test is carried out by the same person with the same technique Skinfoldbased body fat estimation is sensitive to the type of caliper used and technique This method also only measures one type of fat subcutaneous adipose tissue fat under the skin Two individuals might have nearly identical measurements at all of the skin fold sites yet differ greatly in their body fat levels due to differences in other body fat deposits such as visceral adipose tissue fat in the abdominal cavity Some models partially address this problem by including age as a variable in the statistics and the resulting formula Older individuals are found to have a lower body density for the same skinfold measurements which is assumed to signify a higher body fat percentage However older highly athletic individuals might not fit this assumption causing the formulas to underestimate their body density Ultrasound Ultrasound is used extensively to measure tissue structure and has proven to be an accurate technique to measure subcutaneous fat thickness Amode and Bmode ultrasound systems are now used and both rely on using tabulated values of tissue sound speed and automated signal analysis to determine fat thickness By making thickness measurements at multiple sites on the body you can calculate the estimated body fat percentage Ultrasound techniques can also be used to directly measure muscle thickness and quantify intramuscular fat Ultrasound equipment is expensive and not costeffective solely for body fat measurement but where equipment is available as in hospitals the extra cost for the capability to measure body fat is minimal Height and circumference methods  There also exist formulas for estimating body fat percentage from an individuals weight and girth measurements For example the US Navy circumference method compares abdomen or waist and hips measurements to neck measurement and height and other sites claim to estimate ones body fat percentage by a conversion from the body mass index In the US Navy the method is known as the rope and choke There is limited information however on the validity of the rope and choke method because of its universal acceptance as inaccurate and easily falsified The US Army and US Marine Corps also rely on the height and circumference method For males they measure the neck and waist just above the navel Females are measured around the hips waist and neck These measurements are then looked up in published tables with the individuals height as an additional parameter This method is used because it is a cheap and convenient way to implement a body fat test throughout an entire service Methods using circumference have little acceptance outside the Department of Defense due to their negative reputation in comparison to other methods The methods accuracy becomes an issue when comparing people with different body compositions those with larger necks artificially generate lower body fat percentage calculations than those with smaller necks From BMI Body fat can be estimated from body mass index BMI a persons mass in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters if weight is measured in pounds and height in inches the result can be converted to BMI by multiplying by 703 There are a number of proposed formulae that relate body fat to BMI These formulae are based on work by researchers published in peerreviewed journals but their correlation with body fat are only estimates body fat cannot be deduced accurately from BMI Body fat may be estimated from the body mass index by formulae derived by Deurenberg and coworkers When making calculations the relationship between densitometrically determined body fat percentage BF and BMI must take age and sex into account Internal and external crossvalidation of the prediction formulas showed that they gave valid estimates of body fat in males and females at all ages In obese subjects however the prediction formulas slightly overestimated the BF The prediction error is comparable to the prediction error obtained with other methods of estimating BF such as skinfold thickness measurements and bioelectrical impedance The formula for children is different the relationship between BMI and BF in children was found to differ from that in adults due to the heightrelated increase in BMI in children Child body

       "  'raw page text': 'John Boyd Orr 1st Baron BoydOrr of Brechin Mains  23 September 1880 ‚Äì 25 June 1971 styled as Sir John Boyd Orr from 1935 to 1949 was a Scottish teacher doctor biologist and politician who received the Nobel Peace Prize for his scientific research into nutrition and his work as the first DirectorGeneral of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO He was the cofounder and the first President 1960‚Äì1971 of the World Academy of Art and Science WAAS    Early life and family background  John Boyd Orr was born at Kilmaurs near Kilmarnock East Ayrshire Scotland the middle child in a family of seven children His father Robert Clark Orr was a quarry owner and a man of deep religious convictions being a member of the Free Church of Scotland His mother Annie Boyd was the daughter of another quarry master wealthier than Robert Orr and grandmaster of a Freemasons Lodge The family home was well supplied with books and his father was widely read in political sociological and metaphysical subjects as well as religion As he grew older John would regularly discuss these subjects with his father brothers and visiting friends There was also family worship each evening When John was five years old the family suffered a setback when a ship owned by Robert Orr was lost at sea They had to sell their home in Kilmaurs and moved to West Kilbride a village on the North Ayrshire coast According to Kay the new house and environment were a great improvement on Kilmaurs despite the familys reduced means The major part of his upbringing took place in and around West Kilbride He attended the village school until he was thirteen Religion was then an important part of junior education in Scotland and the school gave him a good knowledge of the Bible which stayed with him for the rest of his life At the age of thirteen John won a bursary to Kilmarnock Academy a significant achievement as such bursaries were then rare The new school was some 20 miles 32\\xa0km from his home in West Kilbride but his father owned a quarry about two miles 3\\xa0km from the Academy and John was provided with accommodation nearby His family cut short his education at the Academy because he was spending too much time in the company of the quarry workers where he picked up a wonderful vocabulary of swear words and after four months he returned to the village school in West Kilbride where he continued his education until he was seventeen under the inspirational tutelage of Headmaster John G Lyons There he became a pupil teacher at a salary of ¬£10 for the first year and ¬£20 for the second This was a particularly demanding time for the young Boyd Orr as in addition to his teaching duties and studying at home for his university and teachertraining qualifications he also had to work every day in his fathers business After four years as a pupil teacher at the age of 19 he won a Queens Scholarship to study at a teacher training college in Glasgow plus a bursary which paid for his lodgings there At the same time he entered a threeyear degree course in theology at the University for which the fees were also covered First encounters with poverty As an undergraduate in Glasgow he explored the interior of the city usually at weekends He was shocked by what he found in the povertystricken slums and tenements which then made up a large part of the city Rickets was obvious among the children malnutrition in some cases associated with drunkenness was shown by many of the adults and many of the aged were destitute In his first teaching job after graduating MA in 1902 he was posted to a school in the slums His first class was overcrowded and the children illfed or actually hungry inadequately clothed visibly lousy and physically wretched He resigned after a few days realising that he could not teach children in such a condition and that there was nothing he could do to relieve their misery After working for a few months in his fathers business he taught for three years at Kyleshill School in Saltcoats also a poor area but less squalid than the slums of Glasgow Return to university Boyd Orr needed to augment his teachers salary and decided to do so by instructing an evening class in bookkeeping and accountancy After intensive study he passed the necessary examinations and duly instructed his class The knowledge and skills he learned by studying for and teaching this class were to prove very useful in his later career However his heart was not in teaching and after fulfilling his teaching obligations under the terms of his Queens Scholarship he returned to the University to study biology a subject he had always been interested in since childhood As a precaution he entered simultaneously for a degree in medicine He found the university to be a very stimulating environment Diarmid Noel Paton son of the artist Joseph Noel Paton was Regius Professor of Physiology and Edward Provan Cathcart head of Physiological Chemistry both men of outstanding scientific ability He was impressed by Samuel Gemmill Professor of Clinical Medicine a philosopher whose deep thinking on social affairs also influenced Boyd Orrs approach to such questions Halfway through his medical studies his savings ran out Reluctant to ask his family for support he bought a block of tenanted flats on mortgage with the help of a bank overdraft and used the rents to pay for the rest of his studies On graduating he sold the property for a small profit He graduated BSc in 1910 and MB ChB in 1912 at the age of 32 placing sixth in a year of 200 students Two years later in 1914 he graduated MD with honours receiving the Bellahouston Gold Medal for the most distinguished thesis of the year Research career On leaving the university he took a position as a ships surgeon on a ship trading between Scotland and West Africa choosing this job because it offered the possibility of paying off his bank overdraft faster than any other He resigned after four months when he had repaid the debt He then tried general practice working as a locum in the practice of his family doctor in Saltcoats and was offered a partnership there Realising that a career in medicine was not for him he instead accepted the offer of a twoyear Carnegie research scholarship to work in EP Cathcarts laboratory The work he began there covered malnutrition protein and creatine metabolism the effect of water intake on nitrogenous metabolism in humans and the energy expenditure of military recruits in training The beginnings of the Rowett Research Institute On 1 April 1914 Boyd Orr took charge of a new research institute in Aberdeen a project of a joint committee for research into animal nutrition of the North of Scotland College of Agriculture and Aberdeen University He had been offered the post on the recommendation of EP Cathcart who had originally been offered the job but had turned it down in favour of a chair in physiology in London The joint committee had allocated a budget of ¬£5000 for capital expenditure and ¬£1500 for annual running costs Boyd Orr recognised immediately that these sums were inadequate Using his experience in his fathers business of drawing up plans and estimating costs he submitted a budget of ¬£50000 for capital expenditure and ¬£5000 for annual running costs Meanwhile with the ¬£5000 he had already been allocated he specified a building not of wood as had been envisaged by the committee but of granite and designed so that it could serve as a wing of his proposed ¬£50000 Institute He accepted the lowest tender of ¬£5030 and told the contractors to begin work immediately The committee were not pleased but had to accept the fait accompli When war broke out the contractors were told to finish the walls and roof but to do no more for the time being War service On the outbreak of the First World War he was given leave to join the British Army and asked his former colleague Cathcart to help him obtain a medical commission in an infantry unit overseas Cathcart thought he would be more useful at home and his first commission was in a special civilian section of the RAMC dealing with sanitation Several divisions of nonconscripted recruits were in training in emergency camps at home some of them in very poor sanitary conditions Boyd Orr was able to push through schemes for improvement in hygiene preventing much sickness After 18 months he was posted as Medical Officer to an infantry unit the 1st Sherwood Foresters He spent much of his time in shell holes patching up the many wounded His courage under fire and devotion to duty were recognised by the award of a Military Cross after the Battle of the Somme and of the Distinguished Service Order after Passchendaele He also made arrangements for the battalions diet to be supplemented by vegetables collected from local deserted gardens and fields As a result unlike other units he did not need to send any of the men in his medical charge to hospital He also prevented his men getting trench foot by personally ensuring they were fitted with boots a size larger than usual Worried that he was losing touch with medical and nutritional advances he asked to be transferred to the navy where he thought he would have more time available for reading and research The army was reluctant to let him go but agreed since he was still a civilian surgeon He spent a busy three months in the naval hospital at Chatham studying hard while practicing medicine in the wards before being posted to HMS Furious On board ship his medical duties were light enabling him to do a great deal of reading He was later recalled to work studying food requirements of the army Postwar expansion of the Rowett Research Institute When Boyd Orr returned to Aberdeen in early 1919 his plan for a larger Institute had still not been accepted Indeed even his plans for the annual maintenance grant had to be approved by the Professor of Agriculture in Cambridge Thomas Barlow Wood Despite gaining the latters support his expansion plans were at first rebuffed although he succeeded in having the annual grant increased to ¬£4000 In 1920 he was introduced to John Quiller Rowett a businessman who seemed to have qualms of conscience over the large profits he had made during the war Shortly afterwards the government agreed to finance half the cost of Boyd Orrs plan provided he could raise the other half elsewhere Rowett agreed to provide ¬£10000 for the first year ¬£10000 for the second year and gave an additional ¬£2000 for the purchase of a farm provided that if any work done at the Institute on animal nutrition was found to have a bearing on human nutrition the Institute would be allowed to follow up this work a condition the Treasury was willing to accept By September 1922 the buildings were nearly completed and the renamed Rowett Research Institute was opened shortly thereafter by Queen Mary Boyd Orr proved to be an effective fundraiser from both government and private sources expanding the experimental farm to around 1000 acres 40\\xa0km2 building a wellendowed library and expanding the buildings He also built a centre for accommodating students and scientists attracted by the Institutes growing reputation a reputation enhanced by Boyd Orrs many publications His research output suffered from the time and energy he had to devote to fundraising and in later life he said I still look with bitter resentment at having to spend half my time in the humiliating job of hunting for money for the Institute Through the 1920s his own research was devoted mainly to animal nutrition his focus changed to human nutrition both as a researcher and an active lobbyist and propagandist for improving peoples diets From 1929 to 1944 Boyd Orr was Consultant Director to the Imperial Bureau of Animal Nutrition later the Commonwealth Bureau of Nutrition part of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux which was based at the Rowett Research Institute International and political work In October 1945 Orr was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow after standing as an Independent Progressive candidate He was elected as an independent Member of Parliament MP for the Combined Scottish Universities in a byelection in April 1945 and kept his seat at the general election shortly after He resigned in 1946 After the Second World War Boyd Orr resigned from the Rowett Institute and took several posts most notably as DirectorGeneral of the United Nations new Food and Agriculture Organization FAO Although his tenure in this position was short 1945‚Äì1948 he worked not only to alleviate the immediate postwar food shortage through the International Emergency Food Committee IEFC but also to propose comprehensive plans for improving food production and its equitable distribution‚Äîhis proposal to create a World Food Board Although the board failed to get the support of Britain and the US Boyd Orr laid a firm foundation for the new UN specialized agency He then resigned from the FAO and became director of a number of companies and proved a canny investor in the stock market making a considerable personal fortune When he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1949 he donated the entire financial award to organizations devoted to world peace and a united world government The American Friends Service Committee was one of his nominators He was elevated to the peerage in 1949 as Baron BoydOrr of Brechin Mearn in the County of Angus In 1960 Boyd Orr was elected the first president of the World Academy of Art and Science which was set up by eminent scientists of the day concerned about the potential misuse of scientific discoveries most especially nuclear weapons The University of Glasgow has a Boyd Orr Building and the Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health named after him and the Universitys Hunterian Museum holds his Nobel medal

       "  'raw page text': 'A calorie is a calorie is a tautology used to convey the speakers conviction that the concept of the calorie is in fact a sufficient way to describe energy content of food It has been a commonly cited truism since the early 1960s The tautological phrase means that regardless of the form of food calorie a person consumes whether a carbohydrate protein or fat calorie the energy chemically extracted from the food or the work necessary to burn such a calorie is identical to any other One dietary calorie contains 4184 kilojoules of energy With this knowledge it is easy to assume that all calories have equal value     History In 1878 German nutritionist Max Rubner crafted what he called the isodynamic law The law claims that the basis of nutrition is the exchange of energy and was applied to the study of obesity in the early 1900s by Carl von Noorden Von Noorden had two theories about what caused people to develop obesity The first simply avowed Rubners notion that a calorie is a calorie The second theorized that obesity development depends on how the body partitions calories for either use or storage Since 1925 a calorie has been defined in terms of the joule The definition of a calorie changed in 1948 which became one calorie is equal to approximately 42 joules The related concept of calorie in calorie out is contested and despite having become a commonly held and frequently referenced belief in nutritionism the implications associated with a calorie is a calorie are still being debated The wisdom and effects of skipping meals in an attempt to limit caloric intake is also still largely debated Calorie counting Calorie amounts found on food labels are based on the Atwater system The accuracy of the system is disputed despite no real proposed alternatives For example a 2012 study by a USDA scientist concluded that the measured energy content of a sample of almonds was 32 lower than the estimated Atwater value Furthermore it is known that some calories are lost in waste without ever having been chemically converted or stored The driving mechanism behind caloric intake is absorption which occurs largely in the small intestine and distributes nutrients to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries by means of osmosis diffusion and active transport Fat in particular is emulsified by bile produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder where it is released to the small intestine via the bile duct A relatively lesser amount of absorption composed primarily of water occurs in the large intestine Research Wake Forest University Research In 2007 a group of Wake Forest University researchers published a report from a sixyear longitudinal study in which they fed two groups of monkeys the same number of calories and dietary levels of fat with the only difference being that one group was fed foods higher in trans fat The high trans fat group gained 30 more belly fat compared to their lower trans fat counterparts The researchers concluded that the type of calories consumed do affect body weight It should be noted that the physical activities of the monkeys were not taken into account during this study and the sample size was 38 Harvard University Research In 2011 a group of Harvard University researchers published the results of a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that followed 120877 highly educated men and women over a period of 12 to 20 years The study focused on factors that influence weight gain including diet exercise sleep smoking alcohol intake and television watching Participants began the study as healthy adults Every two years they would complete detailed questionnaires about their eating and other habits The results found that an array of factors influenced the fluctuation of a persons weight The average participant gained about one pound per year Among the results of the study it was found that the types of foods people ate had a larger effect on weight gain than physical activity According to the researchers Consumption of processed foods that are higher in starches refined grains fats and sugars can increase weight gain and These results suggest that future policies and research efforts to prevent obesity should consider food structure and processing as potentially relevant dietary metrics The lead author of the study concluded in an interview that trying to count calories in an effort to lose weight would be futile unless one is examining the kinds of calories being consumed Facts One dietary Calorie contains 4184 joules of energy this may cause individuals to believe that all calories are the same The human body is a highly complex biochemical system that undergoes processes which regulate energy balance The metabolic pathways for protein are less efficient than the metabolic pathways for carbohydrates and fat Protein contains four calories per gram although a large part of the calories are lost as heat when metabolised by the body It may be easy to consume 500 calories worth of ice cream or chocolate in one sitting although it may be difficult to eat 500 calories of eggs or carrot in one sitting Boston Childrens Hospital Clinical Trial In 2012 the Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of a clinical trial performed by a group of researchers that investigated whether dietary composition affected weight loss The study tracked 21 individuals The individuals first lost at least 125 of their body weight and were then placed on one of three different dietary regimens A diet high in protein and fat but with fewer carbohydrates A diet low in fat emphasizing whole grains fruit and vegetables A diet with a low glycemic index focusing on the type of carbohydrates consumed The results showed that the first group burned the most calories but also displayed increased markers of stress and inflammation in the body which can lead to cardiovascular disease among other health problems The second group burned fewer calories than the other two groups and also displayed certain metabolic indicators that typically precede weight gain The third group burned a reasonable number of calories but notably did not display increased markers of diseasecausing stress The researchers concluded that the type of calories consumed does affect the number of calories burned by an individual

       "  'raw page text': 'Canadian health claims by Health Canada the department of the Government of Canada responsible for national health has allowed five scientifically verified disease risk reduction claims to be used on food labels and on food advertising Other countries including the United States and Great Britain have approved similar health claims on food labels    Regulations The Food Directorate of Health Canada is responsible for the development of policies regulations and standards that relate to the use of health claims on foods They assess whether health claims are truthful and not misleading by reviewing mandatory and voluntary premarket submissions Health Claims are regulated under the Food and Drugs Act and the Food and Drug Regulations The Section 51 of the Food and Drugs Act requires that all health claims be truthful and not misleading or deceptive The regulatory requirements permitting the use of claims vary significantly depending on the nature and type of the claim Some claims may be made without premarket approval provided they are truthful and not misleading or deceptive whereas other claims such as disease risk reduction or therapeutic claims are only allowed once a regulatory amendment specifying the conditions for their use has been completed  Manufacturers are responsible for the accuracy of all information on the labels and advertisements for food and for compliance with all relevant food legislation and policies including those pertaining to health claims The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is responsible for ensuring that industry complies with these requirements  There are several types of claims that can be made on food products Food claims express the composition quality quantity or origin of a food product Examples of Food Claims are made in Canada Homestyle Chilli and Fresh Pasta Nutrition nutrient content claims characterizes the energy value of the food or the amount of a nutrient contained in a food It provides a quick and easy way to identify foods with specific nutritional features of interest Examples of nutrition claims are low in sodium sodium free and 100 Calories per serving Health claims is any representation in labeling or advertising that states suggests or implies that a relationship exists between consumption of a food or an ingredient in the food and a persons health There are two categories of health claims General Health Claims and Specific Health Claims General health Claims These claims are broad general claims that promote health through healthy eating or that provide dietary guidance These claims do not refer to a specific or general health effect disease or health condition Example The claim Include low fat product ‚Äùx‚Äù as part of healthy eating ‚Äúhealthy for you‚Äù or ‚Äúhealthy choice‚Äù Specific health claims Disease risk reduction and therapeutic claims Since 2003 Health Canada has allowed certain disease risk reduction claims to be used on food labels or in advertisements These claims are used to describe the link between the characteristics of a diet a food or food constituent and the risk reduction of a disease or the therapeutic effect of a food or food constituent or diet including restoring correcting or modifying body functions Example The claim naming the diet characteristics food or food constituent reduces the risk of heart disease or lowers blood cholesterol can be used when the food carrying the claim meets conditions for use set out in the food regulations Function claims These claims are used to describe the specific physiological effects of foods and food constituents associated with health or performance Example The claim naming the food or food constituent promotes regularity or laxation can be used for coarse wheat bran providing a minimum of 7\\xa0grams of dietary fibre in a reasonable daily intake of the food Nutrient function claims formerly known as biological role claims are a type of function claim that describe the wellestablished functions of nutrients or energy necessary for the maintenance of good health normal growth and development Example The claim Calcium aids in the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth may be used for foods providing a minimum of 5 of the Recommended Daily Intake of the nutrient per serving of stated size and reference amount of the food Health claim 1 A healthy diet low in sodium and high in potassium can reduce the risk of high blood pressure Measurements of dietary sodium Dietary sodium can be measured in two ways Total dietary sodium measures the amount in grams or milligrams of sodium in the food Sodium ratio refers to the amount of sodium per amount of food eaten usually in grams per kilocalorie or milligrams per kilocalorie Dietary potassium can be measured as the total amount of potassium in the diet usually in milligrams It can also be measured in relation to sodium intake as the potassiumsodium ratio in mg Kmg Na or mg Kg Na Only this last measurement shows the effect of dietary potassium as part of the equation the rest measure only sodium intake which is less important overall than the combined effects of potassium and sodium DASH diet Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension DASH is a dietary intervention designed to reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension It emphasizes fruits and vegetables lowfat dairy products whole grains poultry nuts and fish and limits red meats sweets and sweetened drinks It has been found to reduce hypertension in patients even without weight loss or reduction of sodium intake However it is usually used in combination with a sodiumcontrolled diet Research supporting the claim Most research has shown that reducing sodium intake reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseaseCVD and allcause mortality rate A study by Langford in 1983 observed that populations that consume less sodium also tend to have relatively high potassium intake and a lower rate of CVD Within the USA he also noticed racial and class differences in CVD which he suggests may be due to sodium being cheaper to acquire in the diet than potassium since many products contain added salt Reddy and Katan  recommend a salt intake below 5 gday 5000\\xa0mgday and to increase potassium intake by 2  3 gday The study emphasizes that this should be done through dietary changes rather than by taking a dietary supplement containing potassium He et al observed in 1999 that increased salt consumption had a direct relationship to increased risk of CVD and allcause mortality in overweight people Cook et al observed patients 10‚Äì15 years after they had received treatments for prehypertension They found that reducing sodium intake by 12 gday reduced the number of people needing antihypertension treatment by 50 Subjects who had no hypertension when they began the study 10 ‚Äì 15 years earlier were also 50 less likely to require treatment for hypertension Their results suggest that increased sodium intake can cause CVD independently of hypertension  that is even if the patient continues to have normal blood pressure High sodium intake is associated with increased vascular reactivity and growth and myocardial fibrosis which is associated with myocardial disarray They also noticed a direct relationship between sodium intake and ventricular hypertrophy an increase in the mass of the left ventricle of the heart In lay terms this means an enlargement of the heart chamber that pumps blood to body tissues including the cardiac muscle itself In order to reduce blood pressure and prevent hypertension and CVD Cook et al recommend reducing sodium intake by 25  30 from current levels Increasing dietary potassium intake has been shown to have a significant effect on blood pressure in populations with high sodium intake It is not apparent from the study performed by Khaw et al whether there is a difference for populations consuming low amounts of sodium however this is not particularly relevant in Canada where people are more likely to consume excess sodium Dietary sources of sodium In 2007 Joffres et al reported that in the typical Canadian diet 11 of sodium occurs naturally 12 is added during cooking and at the table and 77 is added by industry during processing Their study was to determine whether regulations to limit the amount of salt added by food manufacturers could reduce the prevalence of hypertension by 30 which would substantially reduce Canadian health care costs Research not supporting the claim Some Studies do not recommend that the general healthy population should reduce their sodium intake because they feel that there is no conclusive evidence that this will guarantee a lower incidence of hypertension A major study with this recommendation is the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES I They did observe that people with a lowersodium diet had a lower allcause mortality and cardiovascular disease CVD related mortality rate However because they could not be certain that reducing sodium intake could reduce hypertension and CVD and it was not just one factor in the lifestyles of people who naturally ate a lowersodium diet they did not feel a need to recommend that the general population should reduce sodium intake The Developers of the DASH diet do not recommend reducing dietary sodium because they found that the overall DASH diet is effective even without reducing sodium intake That is an overall healthy diet is more important than only reducing sodium intake even in regulating hypertension A 1996 study by Midgley et al  recommends a reduction in sodium intake for older patients with hypertension but does not support recommendations for the general population to reduce their sodium intake As mentioned above sodium intake can have cardiovascular effects without hypertension It is therefore prudent to reduce sodium intake even if blood pressure is normal It is important to consume an overall healthy diet that essentially follows the Canada Food Guide Reducing sodium intake to recommended levels can reduce the risk of future hypertension and cardiovascular problems and reduction of sodium intake carries no inherent risk Because most of the sodium we consume is added during processing preparing healthy meals at home and adding salt during cooking rather than purchasing ready meals and snacks is an easy way to reduce sodium intake without compromising the flavour and texture that salt provides in food Summary Most studies to date have shown that reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake to levels recommended in Canadian nutritional guidelines such as RDA can reduce the risk of hypertension cardiovascular disease and allcause mortality Most dietary sodium in Canada is added by food manufacturers during processing and regulations controlling the amount of salt that can be added by food manufacturers may help reduce the prevalence of these illnesses in Canada Health claim 2 A healthy diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D may reduce the risk of osteoporosis In order to make the health claim A healthy diet adequate in calcium and vitamin D and regular physical activity help to achieve strong bones and may reduce the risk of osteoporosis the food must be high or very high in calcium may also be very high in Vitamin D cannot have more Phosphorus than Calcium must be limited in Alcohol and must have more than 40 kcal unless it is a fruit or vegetable Nutrition and bone health The two main calcium centers in the body are found in bones and blood Homeostatic controls of the body ensure that the blood maintains a constant proportion of Ca If there is a decrease in serum calcium levels the body responds by secreting Parathormone PTH from the parathyroid gland into the blood which 1Increases reabsorption of Ca from the kidneys and gastrointestinal tractGI 2Releases calcium from bones into the blood Vitamin D also plays a crucial role in maintaining serum calcium levels Ca in the blood Vitamin D stimulates absorption of calcium from the GI tract through its interaction with receptors in the enterocyte Vitamin D also increases transcription of genes that code for Calbindin As the name implies Calbindin functions as a calciumbinding protein thereby enhancing calcium absorption As a result of the body scavenging for calcium from bones the bones may become fragile brittle and weak which in prolonged states can lead to osteoporosis and or bone fractures Conversely if there is an adequate level of Ca in the blood PTH will be inhibited Similarly in the case where there is an excess of Ca in the blood it will be stored in bones as this is the nutritional reserve for Calcium and Phosphorus  Bone depends upon dietary intake to supply the bulk materials needed for synthesis of the extracellular material which composes more than 95 of bone These bulk materials are mainly calcium phosphorus and protein Roughly half the volume of the extracellular material of bone consists of protein and the other half of calcium phosphate crystals It is selfevident that a growing organism cannot amass this structural material if the bulk components of bone are not present in adequate amounts in the diet It is for this reason that bone growth is stunted during general malnutrition and specific bone abnormalities develop with deficiencies in protein ascorbic acid vitamin D magnesium zinc copper and manganese to name only a few  Research supporting the claim There is a significant body of evidence which establishes that high calcium intakes augment bone gain during growth retards agerelated bone loss and reduces osteoporotic fracture risk A metaanalysis study in 2007 assessed whether calcium supplementation can reduce osteoporotic fractures The metaanalysis included all the randomized trials in which calcium or calcium in combination with vitamin D was used to prevent fracture and osteoporotic bone loss In total 63 897 individuals were analysed most of whom were women n58 785 92 with a mean age of 678 years SD 97 In trials that reported fracture as an outcome 17 trials n52 625 treatment was associated with a 12 risk reduction in fractures of all types In trials that reported bonemineral density as an outcome 23 trials n41 419 the treatment was associated with a reduced rate of bone loss of 054 035‚Äì073 plt00001 at the hip and 119 076‚Äì161 plt00001 in the spine The fracture risk reduction was significantly greater 24 in trials in which the compliance rate was high plt00001 The treatment effect was better with calcium doses of 1200\\xa0mg or more than with doses less than 1200\\xa0mg 080 vs 094 p0006 and with vitamin D doses of 800 IU or more than with doses less than 800 IU 0¬∑84 vs 0¬∑87 p0¬∑03 Evidence supports the use of calcium or calcium in combination with vitamin D supplementation in the preventive treatment of osteoporosis in people aged 50 years or older For best therapeutic effect minimum doses of 1200\\xa0mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D for combined calcium plus vitamin D supplementation is recommended Dietary recommendations Current recommendations for Calcium are 1000\\xa0mg per day for people aged 19‚Äì50 years 1200\\xa0mg per day for people over the age of 51 years The Upper Tolerable intake is 25 gday  Health claim 3 A healthy diet low in saturated and trans fat reduces the risk of heart disease The Canadian health claim ‚ÄúA healthy diet low in saturated and trans fat and reduced risk of heart disease‚Äù is commonly accepted and correlated Saturated fatty acids do not contain any carbontocarbon double bonds in the fatty acid chain Trans fatty acids contain carbontocarbon double bonds in the trans confirmation During the past several decades reduction of fat intake has been one of the main focuses from a dietary perspective During these decades fats have been progressively gaining a greater correlation with health complications especially heart disease Subsequently the food industry had been taking notice of this more labels like ‚Äúfatfree‚Äù or ‚Äúlowfat‚Äù appeared on food packaging Research supporting the claim 80082 women who were between 34 and 59 years of age having no known stroke cancer coronary heart disease hypercholesterolemia or diabetes in 1980 were studied regarding dietary fat intake and its correlation with coronary heart disease They found that with each 5 increase of energy intake from saturated fat with the same energy intake from carbohydrates was associated with a 17 increase in the risk of coronary heart disease A related study found that the types of fat consumed is much more important than the amount of fat which is consumed with regards to coronary heart disease Controlled clinical trials have proved that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat was much more effective in lowering serum cholesterol and reducing risk of CHD compared to reducing total fat consumption When compared to saturated fatty acids transfatty acids have a much greater ability to turn Highdensity lipoprotein HDL into Lowdensity lipoprotein LDL HDL commonly referred to as a ‚Äúgood cholesterol‚Äù due to its ability to remove cholesterol from clogs in arteries LDL subsequently is known as a ‚Äúbad cholesterol‚Äù since high levels of it is usually an indication of heart disease The loss of HDL and creation of LDL is highly likely to lead to CHD complications Beneficial fatty acids Despite the fact that transfatty acids are not saturated does not correlate to all unsaturated fats lead to CHD Omega3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated cisfatty acids which are an essential fatty acid which the body cannot produce They are found to prevent and manage cardiovascular disease in clinical interventions They do not change serum lipid concentrations but reduce blood clotting in vessel walls Canada‚Äôs Food Guide recommendations Canadas Food Guide recommends 30‚Äì45\\xa0mL consumption of unsaturated fat each day to get the fat you require for the day This amount includes oil used for cooking salad dressings margarine and mayonnaise Examples of unsaturated vegetable oils they included were canola corn flaxseed olive peanut soybean sunflower Canadas Food Guide also recommends limiting the consumption of food and beverages high in saturated and trans fat Health claim 4 A healthy diet rich in vegetables and fruits may reduce the risk of some types of cancer Scientific literature shows that consuming a ‚Äúvariety‚Äù of fruits and vegetables is linked with reduction of some cancers There is insufficient evidence to support any one fruitvegetable or food constituent with a reduction of cancer occurrence Fruits and vegetables have a wide range of nutrients and phytochemicals thus to achieve optimal nutrient levels a variety is recommended Some types of cancer signifies that not all types of cancers are diet related and thus not all types of cancer can be reduced by a dietary change The statement ‚Äúmay help‚Äù eliminates consumer confusion that diet is the only factors in reducing risk of some types of cancers The wording of this disease reduction health claim cannot be modified in any way However words numbers or signs can be added before or after the claim provided that they do not change the nature of the claim Regulations This claim is only allowed on certain fruits and vegetables listed below Fresh frozen canned or dried vegetable Fresh frozen canned or dried fruit Vegetable or fruit juice Combination of the foods listed above This claim is not allowed on some fruits and vegetables Potatoes yams cassava plantain corn mushrooms mature legumes and their juices Vegetable or fruit used as condiments garnishes or flavourings including maraschino cherries glace fruit candied fruit and onion flakes Jams or jam type spreads marmalades preserves and jellies Olives Powdered vegetable or fruit Mature seeds of legumes such as kidney beans are excluded from this claim however young and immature pods of legumes such as edible podded peas Additionally the food cannot contain 05 alcohol or lessThe claim is not extended to those foods because there is insufficient scientific evidence about any beneficial properties Benefits of fruits and vegetables Fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer due to 1Beneficial properties of the micronutrients in fruits and vegetables such as vitamins minerals antioxidants 2Consumption of fruits and vegetables may decrease the consumption of other less healthy alternatives Current Canadian intakes of fruits and vegetables According to Statistics Canada during 2008 Canadians ate an average of 795\\xa0kg vegetables per person about 4\\xa0kg lower than in 2005 when Canadians consumed 835\\xa0kg per person Potatoes were the most consumed vegetable with 44 followed by carrots lettuce onions and tomatoes which marked a cumulative 29 of all vegetables consumed During 2008 fruit consumption in Canada increased to a record high 475\\xa0kg per person Fresh fruit consumption remains the same as in previous years however processed fruit consumption increased by 7 Berries such as strawberries cranberries blackberries and blueberries have had a substantial consumption increase to 5\\xa0kg by Canadians in 2008 Oranges also remain a major part of fruit consumption at 49\\xa0kg per person Canada‚Äôs Food Guide recommendations The recommended number of daily servings in healthy adults aged 19‚Äì50 is 78 servings for women and 810 servings for men Consumption of a ‚Äúvariety‚Äù of fruits and vegetables is emphasized as well as consumption of whole foods rather than their juices Also recommended is to have at least one dark green and one orange vegetable per day Moreover the Canada Food Guide suggests that Canadians should consume fruits and vegetables with little or no added salt sugar or fat Research supporting the claim Scientific studies have found a relationship between some cancers and fruit and vegetable intake and are the basis for making it one of Canada‚Äôs five Health Claims Some studies have looked at overall intake of fruits and vegetables and its relationship with certain types of cancer Other studies have looked at specific nutrients found in certain fruits and vegetables such as Vitamins Minerals and antioxidants and their relationship with cancer A review conducted by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research has concluded that there is a considerable amount of convincing evidence to support the claim suggesting a protective effect of fruits and vegetables against some cancers A diet rich in fruits and vegetables are found to have a protective effect and reduce the occurrence of breast cancer An analysis of 12case control studies has been conducted in Oxford and found that fruits and vegetables have a consistent protective effect against breast cancer In particular scholars found that Vitamin C intake had the most statistically significant inverse association with breast cancer The study concludes that if this relationship represents causality then it is estimated that breast cancer might be prevented in 24 of postmenopausal women and 16 of premenopausal women There is an established relationship between cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract oral cavity pharynx larynx and esophagus and fruit and vegetable consumption An EPIC European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study was conducted during 19921998 in which 345904 people were studied using a dietary questionnaire During 1998 data was collected and an inverse association was found between fruit and vegetable intake and upper aerodigestive tract cancer occurrence The large study recommends an increase of fruit and vegetable consumption in order to reduce the risk of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract Some fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants which are also linked with cancer reduction risks Micronutrient antioxidants Vitamin E Vitamin C Vitamin A Bcarotene lycopene neutralize free radicals in the body and thus prevent cell damage and oxidative damage to DNA The Journal of Internal medicine published a paper in 2007 which reviews 41 studies conducted concerning Vitamin C and Vitamin E and their role in cancer prevention and treatment Thirty eight studies did show statistically insufficient beneficial effects of Vitamin E and C on cancer patients Three of the studies show that there are statistically significant beneficial results Overall the systemic review of literature does not support the hypothesis that increased intake of Vitamin E and C in the form of supplements can help prevent or treat cancer and that more studies need to be done A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute was done on 1300 prostate cancer patients Overall the risk of prostate cancer was unaffected by receiving dietary supplemental antioxidants However the results in smokers show that an increase in Vitamin E and Bcarotene are statistically significant and are associated with reduced risk of the disease Lycopene is a strong antioxidant found in large quantities in tomatoes as well as other red fruits and vegetables It has recently been a subject of great research concerning many potential beneficial properties in the human body There has been some research suggesting that it may reduce the risk of some types of cancer including colorectal lung and cervical cancer However a review done by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA in 2007 looks at 168 research studies and concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support a relationship of lycopene and a reduction of any cancer Overall no single nutrient has been found to reduce the risk of cancer However a definite correlation has been found in fruit and vegetable intake and reduced risk of cancer therefore consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables is recommended Due to an extensive and conclusive research done in this area Canada has officially made this a Disease Reduction Health Claim in 1997 However much more research needs to be done in order to identify which chemicals in fruits and vegetables are responsible for a reduced risk of cancer Health claim 5 Nonfermentable carbohydrates in gums and hard candies can reduce dental caries Product labelling regulations According to Health Canada the chewing gums confectionery or breath freshening products are the only types of products that may contain this health claim As follows the following phrases are allowed to be printed on the mentioned product packaging Allowed phrases Wont cause cavities Does not promote tooth decay Does not promote dental caries Noncariogenic Tooth friendly this phrase is allowed to be printed with one of the previous phrases In addition to the product type specificity the products must contain one or more of these noncariogenic sweeteners also known as nonfermentable carbohydrates Allowed sweeteners xylitol sorbitol sorbitol syrup mannitol maltitol maltitol syrup isomalt lactitol hydrogenated starch hydrolysates acesulfame K aspartame or sucralose Involvement of bacteria in development of dental caries The main culprits in creation of dental carries are cariogenic microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans and sugar see dental carries for detailed explanation of tooth cavity formation Research supporting the claim There are several studies that show the positive effect of nonfermentable carbohydrates such as xylitol and sorbitol the most commonly used sugar substitutes in gums and candies on the reduction of dental caries In one study in Belize done on 1277 school children of the mean age of 102 years which were given gums with the contents of either xylitol xylitolsorbitol sorbitol or sucrose to chew under teachers supervision daily After a dental exam after 16 28 and 40 months the results showed the most significant reduction in dental caries by the consumption of the xylitol gum Relative Risk  027 For the sorbitol gum the RR  074 while the sucrose gum increased the incidence of dental caries RR  120 In another study in Belize done on sixyearold children given xylitol or sorbitol pellets to chew the results showed the Relative Risk to be 035 and 044 relative This study shows that although both xylitol and sorbitol are effective in reduction of incidence of dental caries xylitol is more effective In yet another study done on school children in Estonia that were either given xylitol gums or hard candies to cheweat for three and two years respectively the results showed overall results in reduction caries rates versus the control group to be 535 for gums and 3359 for candies Overall all these studies and more show that nonfermentable carbohydrates can reduce dental caries but lets look at one study that didnt get quite the same results Research not supporting the claim This one study in Madagascar done on school children in grades 1 and 4 were given a schoolbased oral health education program In addition to that all children had to undergo supervised toothbrushing daily The group was then split into control group and test group where the test group received two types of gum to chew 35 times a day One type of gum was polyol while the other contained a mix of sorbitol 555 xylitol 43 and carbamide 23 After 3 years of this program the results of the dental exams showed no significant difference between the test and control groups It is thought that due to the daily supervised toothbrushing the groups were similar in their overall oral hygiene and therefore the significant difference between the results was reduced Claims under consideration A healthy diet rich in a variety of vegetables fruit and whole grain products and reduced risk of heart disease and A diet rich in folate along with a daily folic acid supplement and reduced risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord A diet rich in folate along with a daily folic acid supplement and reduced risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord For the past decades lack of folate vitamin B12 had been linked to risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord specifically neural tube defect Neural tube defect is the most common brain and spinal cord related defect in Canada today In a randomized controlled doubleblind trial in South Wales 44 women who had one child with neural tube defect took 4\\xa0mg of folic acid a day before and during pregnancy This resulted in no recurrences amongst these who received supplementation Concluding that folic acid supplementation might be an effective method of neural tube defect prevention In another related study it was stated that folic acid prevents 70 percent of neural tube defects but its mode of action is unclear Not fully understanding the mechanism of how folate prevents neural tube defects may be a concern that is preventing Canada from allowing it to be a health claim Also if this becomes a health claim it will be the first Canadian health claim recommending a natural health product supplement Thus more research on this topic is required to insure safety to Canadians References  External links Health Canada ',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'A carbohydrate is a biological molecule consisting of carbon C hydrogen H and oxygen O atoms usually with a hydrogen‚Äìoxygen atom ratio of 21 as in water in other words with the empirical formula CmH2On where m could be different from n This formula holds true for monosaccharides Some exceptions exist for example deoxyribose a sugar component of DNA has the empirical formula C5H10O4 Carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon structurally it is more accurate to view them as polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones The term is most common in biochemistry where it is a synonym of saccharide a group that includes sugars starch and cellulose The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups monosaccharides disaccharides oligosaccharides and polysaccharides Monosaccharides and disaccharides the smallest lower molecular weight carbohydrates are commonly referred to as sugars The word saccharide comes from the Greek word œÉŒ¨Œ∫œáŒ±œÅŒøŒΩ s√°kkharon meaning sugar While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix ose For example grape sugar is the monosaccharide glucose cane sugar is the disaccharide sucrose and milk sugar is the disaccharide lactose Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms Polysaccharides serve for the storage of energy eg starch and glycogen and as structural components eg cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods The 5carbon monosaccharide ribose is an important component of coenzymes eg ATP FAD and NAD and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA The related deoxyribose is a component of DNA Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system fertilization preventing pathogenesis blood clotting and development In food science and in many informal contexts the term carbohydrate often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate starch such as cereals bread and pasta or simple carbohydrates such as sugar found in candy jams and desserts Often in lists of nutritional information such as the USDA National Nutrient Database the term carbohydrate or carbohydrate by difference is used for everything other than water protein fat ash and ethanol This will include chemical compounds such as acetic or lactic acid which are not normally considered carbohydrates It also includes dietary fiber which is a carbohydrate but which does not contribute much in the way of food energy calories even though it is often included in the calculation of total food energy just as though it were a sugar Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of foods The important sources are cereals wheat maize rice potatoes sugarcane fruits table sugar sucrose bread milk etc Starch and sugar are the important carbohydrates in our diet Starch is abundant in potatoes maize rice and other cereals Sugar appears in our diet mainly as sucrose table sugar which is added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam biscuits and cakes and glucose and fructose which occur naturally in many fruits and some vegetables Glycogen is a carbohydrate found in the liver and muscles as animal source Cellulose in the cell wall of all plant tissue is a carbohydrate It is important in our diet as fibre which helps to maintain a healthy digestive system    Structure Formerly the name carbohydrate was used in chemistry for any compound with the formula Cm H2On Following this definition some chemists considered formaldehyde CH2O to be the simplest carbohydrate while others claimed that title for glycolaldehyde Today the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons and includes many biological carbohydrates which deviate from this formula For example while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this For example carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as Nacetyl eg chitin sulphate eg glycosaminoglycans carboxylic acid eg sialic acid and deoxy modifications eg fucose and sialic acid Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called monosaccharides with general formula CH2On where n is three or more A typical monosaccharide has the structure H‚ÄìCHOHxCO‚ÄìCHOHy‚ÄìH that is an aldehyde or ketone with many hydroxyl groups added usually one on each carbon atom that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone functional group Examples of monosaccharides are glucose fructose and glyceraldehydes However some biological substances commonly called monosaccharides do not conform to this formula eg uronic acids and deoxysugars such as fucose and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides eg formaldehyde CH2O and inositol CH2O6 The openchain form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a closed ring form where the aldehydeketone carbonyl group carbon CO and hydroxyl group ‚ÄìOH react forming a hemiacetal with a new C‚ÄìO‚ÄìC bridge Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called polysaccharides or oligosaccharides in a large variety of ways Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed For example deoxyribose a component of DNA is a modified version of ribose chitin is composed of repeating units of Nacetyl glucosamine a nitrogencontaining form of glucose Division Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes ketones alcohols acids their simple derivatives and their polymers having linkages of the acetal type They may be classified according to their degree of polymerization and may be divided initially into three principal groups namely sugars oligosaccharides and polysaccharides DP   Degree of polymerization Monosaccharides   Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be hydrolyzed to smaller carbohydrates They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups The general chemical formula of an unmodified monosaccharide is C‚Ä¢H2On literally a carbon hydrate Monosaccharides are important fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids The smallest monosaccharides for which n3 are dihydroxyacetone and D and Lglyceraldehydes Classification of monosaccharides  Monosaccharides are classified according to three different characteristics the placement of its carbonyl group the number of carbon atoms it contains and its chiral handedness If the carbonyl group is an aldehyde the monosaccharide is an aldose if the carbonyl group is a ketone the monosaccharide is a ketose Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses those with four are called tetroses five are called pentoses six are hexoses and so on These two systems of classification are often combined For example glucose is an aldohexose a sixcarbon aldehyde ribose is an aldopentose a fivecarbon aldehyde and fructose is a ketohexose a sixcarbon ketone Each carbon atom bearing a hydroxyl group OH with the exception of the first and last carbons are asymmetric making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each R or S Because of this asymmetry a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula Using Le Belvant Hoff rule the aldohexose Dglucose for example has the formula C¬∑H2O6 of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic making Dglucose one of 2416 possible stereoisomers In the case of glyceraldehydes an aldotriose there is one pair of possible stereoisomers which are enantiomers and epimers 1 3dihydroxyacetone the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar otherwise it is an L sugar The D and L prefixes should not be confused with d or l which indicate the direction that the sugar rotates plane polarized light This usage of d and l is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry Ringstraight chain isomerism  The aldehyde or ketone group of a straightchain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group on a different carbon atom to form a hemiacetal or hemiketal forming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms Rings with five and six atoms are called furanose and pyranose forms respectively and exist in equilibrium with the straightchain form During the conversion from straightchain form to the cyclic form the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen called the anomeric carbon becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below the plane of the ring The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called anomers In the Œ± anomer the OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side trans of the ring from the CH2OH side branch The alternative form in which the CH2OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side cis of the plane of the ring is called the Œ≤ anomer Use in living organisms Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for metabolism being used both as an energy source glucose being the most important in nature and in biosynthesis When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more spaceefficient forms often polysaccharides In many animals including humans this storage form is glycogen especially in liver and muscle cells In plants starch is used for the same purpose The most abundant carbohydrate cellulose is a structural component of the cell wall of plants and many forms of algae Ribose is a component of RNA Deoxyribose is a component of DNA Lyxose is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart Ribulose and xylulose occur in the pentose phosphate pathway Galactose a component of milk sugar lactose is found in galactolipids in plant cell membranes and in glycoproteins in many tissues Mannose occurs in human metabolism especially in the glycosylation of certain proteins Fructose or fruit sugar is found in many plants and in humans it is metabolized in the liver absorbed directly into the intestines during digestion and found in semen Trehalose a major sugar of insects is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight Disaccharides   Two joined monosaccharides are called a disaccharide and these are the simplest polysaccharides Examples include sucrose and lactose They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a covalent bond known as a glycosidic linkage formed via a dehydration reaction resulting in the loss of a hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group from the other The formula of unmodified disaccharides is C12H22O11 Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable Sucrose pictured to the right is the most abundant disaccharide and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in plants It is composed of one Dglucose molecule and one Dfructose molecule The systematic name for sucrose OŒ±Dglucopyranosyl1‚Üí2Dfructofuranoside indicates four things Its monosaccharides glucose and fructose Their ring types glucose is a pyranose and fructose is a furanose How they are linked together the oxygen on carbon number 1 C1 of Œ±Dglucose is linked to the C2 of Dfructose The oside suffix indicates that the anomeric carbon of both monosaccharides participates in the glycosidic bond Lactose a disaccharide composed of one Dgalactose molecule and one Dglucose molecule occurs naturally in mammalian milk The systematic name for lactose is OŒ≤Dgalactopyranosyl1‚Üí4Dglucopyranose Other notable disaccharides include maltose two Dglucoses linked Œ±14 and cellulobiose two Dglucoses linked Œ≤14 Disaccharides can be classified into two types reducing and nonreducing disaccharides If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose Nutrition  Carbohydrate consumed in food yields 387 calories of energy per gram for simple sugars and 357 to 412 calories per gram for complex carbohydrate in most other foods Relatively high levels of carbohydrate are associated with processed foods or refined foods made from plants including sweets cookies and candy table sugar honey soft drinks breads and crackers jams and fruit products pastas and breakfast cereals Lower amounts of carbohydrate are usually associated with unrefined foods including beans tubers rice and unrefined fruit Animalbased foods generally have the lowest carbohydrate levels although milk does contain a high proportion of lactose Organisms typically cannot metabolize all types of carbohydrate to yield energy Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of energy Many organisms also have the ability to metabolize other monosaccharides and disaccharides but glucose is often metabolized first In Escherichia coli for example the lac operon will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present but if both lactose and glucose are present the lac operon is repressed resulting in the glucose being used first see Diauxie Polysaccharides are also common sources of energy Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose most organisms however cannot metabolize cellulose or other polysaccharides like chitin and arabinoxylans These carbohydrate types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists Ruminants and termites for example use microorganisms to process cellulose Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very digestible they represent an important dietary element for humans called dietary fiber Fiber enhances digestion among other benefits Based on the effects on risk of heart disease and obesity in otherwise healthy middleaged adults the Institute of Medicine recommends that American and Canadian adults get between 45‚Äì65 of dietary energy from wholegrain carbohydrates The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization jointly recommend that national dietary guidelines set a goal of 55‚Äì75 of total energy from carbohydrates but only 10 directly from sugars their term for simple carbohydrates Classification Nutritionists often refer to carbohydrates as either simple or complex However the exact distinction between these groups can be ambiguous The term complex carbohydrate was first used in the US Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs publication Dietary Goals for the United States 1977 where it was intended to distinguish sugars from other carbohydrates which were perceived to be nutritionally superior However the report put fruit vegetables and wholegrains in the complex carbohydrate column despite the fact that these may contain sugars as well as polysaccharides This confusion persists as today some nutritionists use the term complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible saccharide present in a whole food where fiber vitamins and minerals are also found as opposed to processed carbohydrates which provide energy but few other nutrients The standard usage however is to classify carbohydrates chemically simple if they are sugars monosaccharides and disaccharides and complex if they are polysaccharides or oligosaccharides In any case the simple vs complex chemical distinction has little value for determining the nutritional quality of carbohydrates Some simple carbohydrates eg fructose raise blood glucose slowly while some complex carbohydrates starches especially if processed raise blood sugar rapidly The speed of digestion is determined by a variety of factors including which other nutrients are consumed with the carbohydrate how the food is prepared individual differences in metabolism and the chemistry of the carbohydrate The USDAs Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 call for moderate to highcarbohydrate consumption from a balanced diet that includes six oneounce servings of grain foods each day at least half from whole grain sources and the rest from enriched The glycemic index GI and glycemic load concepts have been developed to characterize food behavior during human digestion They rank carbohydraterich foods based on the rapidity and magnitude of their effect on blood glucose levels Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food glucose is absorbed while glycemic load is a measure of the total absorbable glucose in foods The insulin index is a similar more recent classification method that ranks foods based on their effects on blood insulin levels which are caused by glucose or starch and some amino acids in food Effects of dietary carbohydrate restriction See also Lowcarbohydrate diet Carbohydrates are a common source of energy in living organisms however no single carbohydrate is an essential nutrient in humans Humans are able to obtain all of their energy requirement from protein and fats though the potential for some negative health effects of extreme carbohydrate restriction remains as the issue has not been studied extensively yet However in the case of dietary fiber\\xa0‚Äì indigestible carbohydrates which are not a source of energy\\xa0‚Äì inadequate intake can lead to significant increases in mortality Following a diet consisting of very low amounts of daily carbohydrate for several days will usually result in higher levels of blood ketone bodies than an isocaloric diet with similar protein content This relatively high level of ketone bodies is commonly known as ketosis and is very often confused with the potentially fatal condition often seen in type 1 diabetics known as diabetic ketoacidosis Somebody suffering ketoacidosis will have much higher levels of blood ketone bodies along with high blood sugar dehydration and electrolyte imbalance Longchain fatty acids cannot cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier but the liver can break these down to produce ketones However the mediumchain fatty acids octanoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain which normally relies upon glucose for its energy Gluconeogenesis allows humans to synthesize some glucose from specific amino acids from the glycerol backbone in triglycerides and in some cases from fatty acids Metabolism  Carbohydrate metabolism denotes the various biochemical processes responsible for the formation breakdown and interconversion of carbohydrates in living organisms The most important carbohydrate is glucose a simple sugar monosaccharide that is metabolized by nearly all known organisms Glucose and other carbohydrates are part of a wide variety of metabolic pathways across species plants synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis storing the absorbed energy internally often in the form of starch or lipids Plant components are consumed by animals and fungi and used as fuel for cellular respiration Oxidation of one gram of carbohydrate yields approximately 4 kcal of energy while the oxidation of one gram of lipids yields about 9 kcal Energy obtained from metabolism eg oxidation of glucose is usually stored temporarily within cells in the form of ATP Organisms capable of aerobic respiration metabolize glucose and oxygen to release energy with carbon dioxide and water as byproducts Catabolism Catabolism is the metabolic reaction which cells undergo to extract energy There are two major metabolic pathways of monosaccharide catabolism glycolysis and the citric acid cycle In glycolysis oligopolysaccharides are cleaved first to smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called glycoside hydrolases The monosaccharide units can then enter into monosaccharide catabolism In some cases as with humans not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present Carbohydrate chemistry Carbohydrate chemistry is a large and economically important branch of organic chemistry Some of the main organic reactions that involve carbohydrates are Carbohydrate acetalisation Cyanohydrin reaction Lobry de Bruyn‚Äìvan Ekenstein transformation Amadori rearrangement Nef reaction Wohl degradation Koenigs‚ÄìKnorr reaction

chelates better than inorganic minerals This means that lower concentrations can be used in animal feeds In addition animals fed chelated sources of essential trace minerals excrete lower amounts in their faeces and so there is less environmental contamination Mineral chelates also offers health and welfare benefits in animal nutrition    Brief History of Chelates  Since the 1950s animal feeds have been supplemented with essential trace minerals such as copper Cu iron Fe iodine I manganese Mn molybdenum Mo selenium Se and zinc Zn Initially such supplementation was by means of inorganic salts of essential trace elements From the 1960s onwards genetic improvement of farm livestock resulted in increased nutritional requirements for these nutrients Chelated minerals were developed in the 1980s and 1990s Trace mineral chelates have proven to be better than inorganic minerals in meeting the nutritional needs of modern farm animals Role and source of minerals The objective of supplementation with trace minerals is to avoid a variety of deficiency diseases Trace minerals carry out key functions in relation to many metabolic processes most notably as catalysts for enzymes and hormones and are essential for optimum health growth and productivity For example supplementary minerals help ensure good growth bone development feathering in birds hoof skin and hair quality in mammals enzyme structure and functions and appetite Deficiency of trace minerals affect many metabolic processes and so may be manifested by different symptoms such as poor growth and appetite reproductive failures impaired immune responses and general illthrift From the 1950s to the 1990s most trace mineral supplementation of animal diets was in the form of inorganic minerals and these largely eradicated associated deficiency diseases in farm animals The role in fertility and reproductive diseases of dairy cattle highlights that organic forms of Zn are retained better than inorganic sources and so may provide greater benefit in disease prevention notably mastitis and lameness  Sources of essential minerals In recent decades global food animal production has intensified and genetic potential for growth and yields has improved As a result commercial tendencies have been to increase trace mineral supplementationin order to allow for the greater mineral requirements of superior stock reared under industrial conditions Increasing the concentration of inorganic minerals in animal diets has led to several problems The use of high Cu in swine and poultry rations has caused accidental Cu poisoning in more sensitive animals such as sheep grazing pastures fertilised with pig or poultry manure SCAN 2003a Opinion of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition on the use of copper in feedingstuffs Secondly inorganic minerals may form insoluble complexes with other dietary agents resulting in low absorption In addition it is thought that the positive charge of many inorganic minerals reduces access to the enterocytes due to repulsion by the negatively charged mucin layer and competition for binding sites Finally the poor retention and high excretion rates of inorganic minerals led to environmental concerns during the 1980s and 1990s especially in Europe Opinion of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition on the use of zinc in feedingstuffs The European Union is concerned about possible detrimental effects of excess supplementation with trace minerals on the environment or human and animal health and so in 2003 legislated a reduction in permitted feed concentrations of several trace metals Co Cu Fe Mn and Zn Research in trace element nutrition has led to the development of more bioavailable organic minerals including trace minerals derived from chelates Chelates allow a lower supplementation rate of trace minerals with an equivalent or improved effect on animal health growth and productivity  Some samples of natural minerals at the Wikimedia Commons Particular types of Chelates They are in summary Chelates are organic molecules normally consisting of 2 organic parts with an essential trace mineral occupying a central position and held in place by covalent bonding Proteinate are a particular type of chelate in which the mineral is chelated with shortchain peptides and amino acids derived from hydrolysed soy proteins and contain roughly 1020 of the trace mineral In proteinates minerals are bound to various amino acids with different levels of stability Aminoacid complex such as glycinates or methionates are other particular types of chelate in which the mineral is chelated with an amino acid Based on one single type of aminoacid the product is pure there is only one type of bond or chelation between minerals and the ligand and it is therefore easier to work on stability and ensure a full chelation Moreover depending on the size of amino acid it is also possible to increase the metal content Research   Some notice concluded that the utilisation of organic Cu from a copper chelate or copper lysine were higher than that of inorganic Cu sulfate when fed to rats in the presence and absence of elemental Zn or Fe The data suggest that unlike inorganic Cu organic Cu chelates exhibit absorption and excretion mechanisms that do not interfere with Fe Copper chelate also achieved higher liver Zn suggesting less interference at gut absorption sites in comparison with the other forms of Cu Effect of organic zinc sources on performance zinc status and carcass meat and claw quality in fattening bulls Livestock Prod compared a Zn chelate a Zn polysaccharide complex and ZnO inorganic zinc oxide in bull beef cattle and concluded that the organic forms resulted in some improvement in hoof claw quality Compared the bioavailability of Cu and Zn chelates in sheep with the inorganic sulfate forms at low and high supplementation rates Copper and Zn chelates at the lower rates caused significantly greater increases in blood plasma concentrations than the corresponding treatments with Zn sulfate plt005 and Cu sulfate plt001 In addition Zinc chelate supplementation resulted in significantly greater hoof horn Zn content than did Zn sulfate plt005 At the low supplementation rate Zinc chelate achieved better hoof quality than Zn sulfate plt005 The data suggest that Cu and Zn chelates are more readily absorbed and more easily deposited in key tissues such as hooves in comparison with inorganic Zn forms In weaned piglets evaluated various supplementation rates of organic Zn in the form of a chelate or as a polysaccharide complex and compared these with ZnO zinc oxide at 2000 ppm Feeding lower concentrations of organic Zn greatly decreased the amount of Zn excreted in comparison with inorganic Zn without loss of growth performance Studied a Copper chelate in weaned pigs in comparison with inorganic Cu and sulfate Piglet performance was consistently better with organic Cu at 50 to 100 ppm in comparison with inorganic Cu at 250 ppm In addition organic Cu increased Cu absorption and retention and decreased Cu excretion 77 and 61 respectively compared with 250 ppm inorganic Cu  The effects of an Mg chelate in broiler chickens in comparison with magnesium oxide and an unsupplemented control group Diets for fattening chicken are not normally supplemented with Mg but this study indicated positive effects on performance and meat quality During the first 3 weeks of life the Mg chelate improved feed efficiency significantly in comparison with both the inorganic MgO and the negative control group plt005 Thigh meat pH and oxidative deterioration during storage were also studied The Mg chelate increased thigh meat pH in comparison with the negative control plt005 Mg supplementation significantly reduced chemical indicators TBARS of oxidative deterioration in liver and thigh muscle plt001 with Mg chelate significantly more efficient than MgO plt001 The data suggest that organic Mg in the form of a chelate is capable of reducing oxidation and so improve chicken meat quality A Zn chelate supplement was compared with Zn sulfate in broiler chickensWeight gain and feed intake increased quadratically plt005 with increasing Zn concentrations from the chelate and linearly with Zn sulfate The relative bioavailability of the Zn chelate was 183 and 157 of Zn sulfate for weight gain and tibia Zn respectively The authors concluded that the supplemental concentration of Zn required in cornsoy diets for broilers from 1‚Äì21 days of age would be 98\\xa0mgkg diet as Zn chelate and 201\\xa0mgkg diet as Zn sulfaterespectively The effect of replacing inorganic minerals with organic minerals in broiler chickens One group of chickens received inorganic sulfates of Cu 12 ppm Fe 45 ppm Mn 70 ppm and Zn 37 ppm and their performance was compared to a similar group supplemented with chelates of Cu 25 ppm Fe Mn and Zn all at 10 ppm There were no differences in performance between the birds fed the high inorganic minerals and the birds fed the low organic chelates Faecal concentrations of Cu Fe Mn and Zn were 55 73 46 and 63 respectively of control birds fed inorganic minerals A broiler study reported also compared inorganic and organic mineral supplementation in broiler chickens Control birds were fed Cu Fe Mn Se and Zn in inorganic forms 15 ppm Cu 15 from sulfate 60 ppm Fe from sulfate etcand compared with three treatment groups supplemented with organic forms Apart from improved feathering most likely associated with the presence of organic Se there were no significant performance differences between birds fed inorganic and organic minerals The authors concluded that the use of organic trace minerals permits a reduction of at least 33 in supplement rates in comparison with inorganic minerals without compromising performance References  topics of the works SCAN 2003a Opinion of the Scientific Committee for

       "  'raw page text': 'Every child has the right to adequate nutrition under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights In New Zealand an estimated 100000 New Zealand children go to school every day without breakfast Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights recognises the fundamental right for everyone to be free from hunger‚Äô In the Auckland region there are approximately 43000 children in decile 1 and 2 state schools Of these 57 are Pasifica 30 are MƒÅori and 4 are European The remaining 9 are AsianMiddle Eastern and other ethnic groups The Ministry of Health advised the Minister in 2006 that decile one and two schools draw their students from our most vulnerable communities and cope with multiple issues related to poverty A 2002 Ministry of Health survey found that there is a high percentage of children between the age of 5 to 14 who sometimes or always ate nothing before school compared to a New Zealand Health Survey that found around 15 of children leave for school without eating breakfast The Childrens Commissioner released a Framework for Food in Schools Programme stating Children need to be fed adequately for a range of nutritional educational and social reasons and should be fed regardless of their parents income or status To end this breakfast should be made available to decile 1 and 2 primary intermediate and primary intermediate combined schools    Background The evolution of children‚Äôs right itself to adequate nutrition has fast been on the rise in the last 10 years In 2004 26 of children were reported as living in serious or significant hardship In 2005 the Child Poverty Action Group published Hard to Swallow which sounded alarms about the increasing number of families who resorted to using food banks Key recommendations of the 2005 report that free but good quality breakfasts should be provided for children in decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate schools as a means of ensuring that the most vulnerable children were sufficiently nourished to enable them to learn efficiently at school Past Governments have ignored the problem or helped construct the public debate of the issue portrayed as one of parental failure Poor quality diet has also been portrayed as a matter of personal preference The Labour Government in 20002008 responded to the poor diet with social marketing campaigns such as PushPlay aiming to encourage families to eat healthier foods to improve peoples health and fitness In the early 2000s the Treasury found poor child nutrition is a risk factor for the childs ability to learn The current National Government has avoided the debate about food insecurity instead claiming ‚Äòpoor food choices‚Äô and removed Labour‚Äôs public health initiates around healthy eating and exercise in 2008 Nationally there are 115000 children in decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate and secondary schools with private charities schools and teachers scrambling to fill the nutrition gaps of many of these students New Zealand policymakers aim to create equality of opportunity for children as part of a broader social investment strategy Providing breakfast free to all children attending decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate schools would be one positive way to achieve this stated policy aim It would also help redress the balance in favour of the lowincome households that have found themselves left further behind as New Zealand‚Äôs income inequality has grown over the last thirty years International obligations The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child furthers a stand to which the child has a sufficient right to adequate nutrition Relevant provisions are set out in Article 27 States Parties recognise the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the childs physical mental spiritual moral and social development The parents or others responsible for the child have the primary responsibility to secure within their abilities and financial capacities the conditions of living necessary for the childs development States Parties in accordance with national conditions and within their means shall take appropriate measures to assist parents and others responsible for the child to implement this right and shall in the case of need provide material assistance and support programmes particularly with regard to nutrition clothing and housing School food programmes would also be consistent with the conclusion of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in New Zealand The Committee‚Äôs recommendation in paragraph 43 The Committee recommends that the State Party take all necessary measures to provide appropriate support to allow disadvantaged families and their children to move out of poverty in a sustained way while at the same time continuing to provide assistance to those living below the poverty line The Scottish Experiment The Scottish Government have achieved a successful model for breakfast clubs with the particular focus on children with the greatest need The decision here was drawn to provide food for children in school both to improve students education and improve their diets The philosophy behind food in Scottish schools is a ‚Äòwhole school‚Äô approach that recognises food sits within children‚Äôs social context The contrast with the New Zealand government‚Äôs reliance on corporate beneficence and private charity could not be more abrupt Breakfast clubs have been present in Scotland for many years An evaluation of Glasgow‚Äôs project provides some insight into the variations between schools that make a schoolbyschool approach more sensible than a one size fitsall model The evaluation found the factors affecting the likely success and delivery of breakfasts include availability and sustainability of funding availability and sustainability of assistance Paid staff and volunteers can be difficult to recruit and retain local support for the club support for the aims of the club ie whether health promotion is included as part of the programme or whether there is a perception that the programme is a babysitting service school catchment and attendance levels Some schools charged for breakfast and the evaluation found attendance at breakfast clubs was lower in areas where lowincome families are less likely to be able to afford breakfasts operational and logistical issues including food quality and health and safety considerations This may include the safety of children coming to school early eg across busy roads with no supervised crossings New Zealand Programmes New Zealand has no national scheme for food in schools however there are adequate nonGovernment programmes operating in hundreds of schools Boards of Trustees have absolute jurisdiction in the management of the school within the general law of New Zealand The only rules currently mandated by central Government with regard to food in schools is National Administrative Guideline 5 Each board of trustees is also required to provide a safe physical and emotional environment for students promote healthy food and nutrition for all students and comply in full with any legislation currently in force or that may be developed to ensure the safety of students and employees Current programmes KidsCan Providing nonperishable goods such as bread baked beans and spreads to 276 participating schools on a termly basis Nonfood items are also provided such as raincoats and footwear KidsCan receives 150000 per annum from the Government and more substantial amounts from New Zealand business Fruit in Schools Providing fruit to all decile 1 and 2 schools a fully funded Government scheme at around 7 million per annum KickStart Providing Weetbix and milk to 500 participating schools across New Zealand two days a week fully supported by Fonterra and Sanitarium Fonterra Milk in Schools Providing milk and refrigerators to 120 participating schools Health Promotion Agency Breakfast Eaters Promotion this promotion does not include provisions of food Other health promotions in areas including nutrition Garden to Table Programme involving nine schools supported by an international trust to develop edible gardens Health Promoting Schools advisors contracted by the ministry of health work directly within the school Schools and communities do their own things with a mix of community sponsorship private funding and relationships with businesses Generally schools initiate programmes because they are concerned with the quality of the students‚Äô food The Fruit in Schools programme appears to have provided an incentive to shift schools to having a greater focus on the health aspects of foods Funding Schools operate their breakfast programmes at little or no cost and are usually run by the Red Cross Kickstart Project and local churches The National Government in 2013 started to fund 50 of the expansion Food in Schools programme over a fiveyear period Schools have different experiences with recruiting and retaining volunteers from within the community some school programmes are run by teachers others are run by volunteers drawn from within the school and parents Most donations from businesses or individuals tend to be in a way of food rather than money Education Breakfast and Lunch programmes in schools Amendment Bill The Education Breakfast and Lunch programmes in schools Amendment Bill was developed to provide a legislative basis for making food in schools available to all decile 1 to 3 primary and intermediate schools This Bill will amend the Education Act 1989 providing the introduction of a fully funded State breakfast and lunch programmes however was not passed Catering to all decile 1 and 2 schools and other designated schools in New Zealand The meals will be available to all enrolled students in these schools free of charge and will be required to meet Ministry of Health nutritional guidelines The introduction of State led and funded food in schools programmes in low decile schools has been recommended by the Child Poverty Action Group in their 2011 report Hunger for learning where nutritional barriers to children‚Äôs education and by the Children‚Äôs Commissioner‚Äôs Solutions to child poverty in New Zealand as a key measure to address child poverty In conjunction with the Ministry of Health the Ministry of Education will develop a plan to monitor schools at least once every 12 months to ensure they are providing meals each day they are open for instruction and that the meals follow nutritional guidelines An evaluation of the breakfast and lunch programmes will be conducted within the first 3 years to further develop and improve their effectiveness Benefits of current programmes Breakfast in particular has been found to have a beneficial effect on children‚Äôs study behaviour and attendance and there is mounting evidence that eating a good quality breakfast reduces the risk of obesity Evidence for the benefit of breakfast for children is mixed In large part this is due to benefits diminishing as children get older and exercise more control over their food intake with older children being more likely to skip breakfast altogether For younger children the evidence is clear that breakfast provides a number of benefits Breakfast is the meal most likely to be skipped with only 40 of New Zealand children reporting eating breakfast The Ministry of Health reported that found around 15 of children leave for school without having eaten breakfast and that Maori and Pacific children were less likely to eat breakfast at home every day compared with other groups Breakfast can make a positive contribution to children‚Äôs learning The positive social benefit seen in New Zealand have also been observed overseas Wahlstrom amp Begalle 1999 In Scotland teachers report better attendance and better behaviour from children as a consequence of breakfast clubs there Sheridan 2001 para 17 and in its 2007 report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child UNCROC the Scottish government noted that new universal and subsidised school meal programmes in Scotland were improving children‚Äôs health and academic outcomes References  External links A Framework for Food in schools programmes in New Zealand Childs Rights International Network Zealands

       "  'raw page text': 'Cholesterol from the Ancient Greek chole bile and stereos solid followed by the chemical suffix ol for an alcohol is an organic molecule It is a sterol or modified steroid a type of lipid molecule and is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of all animal cell membranes essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity Cholesterol enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall to protect membrane integrity and cell viability thereby allowing animal cells to change shape rapidly and animals to move unlike bacteria and plant cells which are restricted by their cell walls In addition to its importance for animal cell structure cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones bile acid and vitamin D Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by all animals In vertebrates hepatic cells typically produce the greatest amounts It is absent among prokaryotes bacteria and archaea although there are some exceptions such as Mycoplasma which require cholesterol for growth Fran√ßois Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1769 However it was not until 1815 that chemist Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul named the compound cholesterine    Physiology Since cholesterol is essential for all animal life each cell is capable of synthesizing it by way of a complex 37step process beginning with the mevalonate pathway and ending with a 19step conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol Furthermore it can be absorbed directly from animalbased foods A human male weighing 68\\xa0kg 150\\xa0lb normally synthesizes about 1 gram 1000\\xa0mg per day and his body contains about 35 g mostly contained within the cell membranes Typical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307\\xa0mg above the upper limit recommended by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Most ingested cholesterol is esterified and esterified cholesterol is poorly absorbed The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis For these reasons cholesterol in food seven to ten hours after ingestion has little if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood However during the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various lipoproteins which transport all fats in the water outside cells the concentrations increase It is also important to recognize however that the concentrations measured in the samples of blood plasma vary with the measurement methods used Traditional cheaper methods do not reflect a which lipoproteins are transporting the various fat molecules nor b which cells are ingesting burning or exporting the fat molecules being measured as totals from samples of blood plasma Cholesterol is recycled in the body The liver excretes it in a nonesterified form via bile into the digestive tract Typically about 50 of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the small intestine back into the bloodstream Plants make cholesterol in very small amounts Plants manufacture phytosterols substances chemically similar to cholesterol which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols in place of cholesterol they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract an important protective mechanism The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols which encompass plant sterols and stanols ranges between 200‚Äì300\\xa0mgday depending on eating habits Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700\\xa0mgday Function Cholesterol given that it composes about 30 of all animal cell membranes is required to build and maintain membranes and modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures The hydroxyl group on cholesterol interacts with the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the membrane alongside the nonpolar fattyacid chain of the other lipids Through the interaction with the phospholipid fattyacid chains cholesterol increases membrane packing which both alters membrane fluidity and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells do not need to build cell walls like plants and most bacteria The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane as the molecule is in a trans conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar In this structural role cholesterol also reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes hydrogen ions and sodium ions Within the cell membrane cholesterol also functions in intracellular transport cell signaling and nerve conduction Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrincoated pits including caveoladependent and clathrindependent endocytosis The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin MŒ≤CD to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules In multiple layers cholesterol and phospholipids both electrical insulators can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue For many neuron fibers a myelin sheath rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses Demyelination loss of some of these Schwann cells is believed to be part of the basis for multiple sclerosis Within cells cholesterol is also a precursor molecule for several biochemical pathways For example it is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of vitamin D and all steroid hormones including the adrenal gland hormones cortisol and aldosterone as well as the sex hormones progesterone estrogens and testosterone and their derivatives The liver excretes cholesterol into biliary fluids which is then stored in the gallbladder Bile contains bile salts which solubilize fats in the digestive tract and aid in the intestinal absorption of fat molecules as well as the fatsoluble vitamins A D E and K Biosynthesis All animal cells manufacture cholesterol for both membrane structure and other uses with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function About 80 of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the liver other sites of higher synthesis rates include the intestines adrenal glands and reproductive organs Synthesis within the body starts with the mevalonate pathway where two molecules of acetyl CoA condense to form acetoacetylCoA This is followed by a second condensation between acetyl CoA and acetoacetylCoA to form 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl CoA HMGCoA  This molecule is then reduced to mevalonate by the enzyme HMGCoA reductase Production of mevalonate is the ratelimiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for statins a class of cholesterol lowering drugs  Mevalonate is finally converted to isopentenyl pyrophosphate IPP through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires ATP  Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase   Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form squalene by the action of squalene synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum   Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form lanosterol Finally lanosterol is converted to cholesterol through a 19step process    The final 19 steps to cholesterol contain NADPH and Oxygen to help oxidize methyl groups for removal of carbons mutases to move alkene groups and NADH to help reduce ketones   Konrad Bloch and Feodor Lynen shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 for their discoveries concerning some of the mechanisms and methods of regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism though lots of complexities remain to be sorted out Regulation of cholesterol synthesis Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein SREBP sterol regulatory elementbinding protein 1 and 2 In the presence of cholesterol SREBP is bound to two other proteins SCAP SREBP cleavageactivating protein and INSIG1 When cholesterol levels fall INSIG1 dissociates from the SREBPSCAP complex which allows the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P site1 protease and site2 protease two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor to bind to the sterol regulatory element SRE which stimulates the transcription of many genes Among these are the lowdensity lipoprotein LDL receptor and HMGCoA reductase The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream whereas HMGCoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr Michael S Brown and Dr Joseph L Goldstein in the 1970s In 1985 they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high HMGCoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain responsible for its catalytic function and a membrane domain The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation Increasing concentrations of cholesterol and other sterols cause a change in this domains oligomerization state which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the proteosome This enzymes activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMPactivated protein kinase Because this kinase is activated by AMP which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low Dietary sources Animal fats are complex mixtures of triglycerides stored energy see Introduction to Energy Storage\\xa0 with lesser amounts of both the phospholipids and cholesterol molecules from which all animal and human cell membranes are constructed Since all animal cells manufacture cholesterol all animalbased foods contain cholesterol in varying amounts Major dietary sources of cholesterol include cheese egg yolks beef pork poultry fish and shrimp Human breast milk also contains significant quantities of cholesterol From a dietary perspective plant cells do not manufacture cholesterol and it is not found in plant foods Some plant foods such as avocado flax seeds and peanuts contain phytosterols which compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines reducing the absorption of both dietary and bile cholesterol However a typical diet contributes on the order of 02 grams of phytosterols which is not enough to have a significant impact on blocking cholesterol absorption Phytosterols intake can be supplemented through the use of phytosterolcontaining functional foods or dietary supplements that are recognized as having potential to reduce levels of LDLcholesterol Some supplemental guidelines have recommended doses of phytosterols in the 16‚Äì30\\xa0grams per day range Health Canada EFSA ATP III FDA A recent metaanalysis demonstrating a 12 reduction in LDLcholesterol at a mean dose of 21\\xa0grams per day However the benefits of a diet supplemented with phytosterols have been questioned In 2016 the United States Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended that Americans eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible Increased dietary intake of industrial trans fats is associated with an increased risk in allcause mortality and cardiovascular diseases Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL Based on such evidence and evidence implicating low HDL and high LDL levels in cardiovascular disease see Hypercholesterolemia many health authorities advocate reducing LDLcholesterol through changes in diet in addition to other lifestyle modifications Rats subjected to highfat or fructose diets became dyslipidemic However well designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials investigating patientrelevant outcomes of lowfat diets for otherwise healthy people with hypercholesterolaemia are lacking Moreover for familial hypercholesterolaemia large parallel randomized controlled trials are still needed to investigate the effectiveness of a cholesterollowering diet and the addition of omega3 fatty acids soya protein plant sterols or stanols Plasma transport and regulation of absorption   As an isolated molecule cholesterol is only minimally soluble in water it dissolves into the waterbased bloodstream only at exceedingly small concentrations Instead cholesterol is transported within lipoproteins complex discoidal particles with exterior amphiphilic proteins and lipids whose outwardfacing surfaces are watersoluble and inwardfacing surfaces are lipidsoluble ie transport via emulsification Triglycerides and cholesterol esters are carried internally Phospholipids and cholesterol being amphipathic are transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle There are several types of lipoproteins in the blood In order of increasing density they are chylomicrons verylowdensity lipoprotein VLDL intermediatedensity lipoprotein IDL lowdensity lipoprotein LDL and highdensity lipoprotein HDL Lower proteinlipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical although some is carried as its native free alcohol form the cholesterolOH group facing the water surrounding the particles while others as fatty acyl esters known also as cholesterol esters within the particles Lipoprotein particles are organized by complex apolipoproteins typically 80‚Äì100 different proteins per particle which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles Lipoprotein particles thus include a molecular addresses which play key roles in distribution and delivery of fats around the body in the water outside cells Chylomicrons the least dense cholesterol transport molecules contain apolipoprotein B48 apolipoprotein C and apolipoprotein E the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain in their shells Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterolrich chylomicron remnants and taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver VLDL molecules are produced by the liver from triacylglycerol and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids These molecules contain apolipoprotein B100 and apolipoprotein E in their shells and are degraded by lipoprotein lipase on the blood vessel wall to IDL Blood vessels cleave and absorb triacylglycerol from IDL molecules increasing the concentration of cholesterol IDL molecules are then consumed in two processes half is metabolized by HTGL and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become LDL molecules with the highest concentration of cholesterol within them LDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers Each one contains approximately 1500 molecules of cholesterol ester LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100 recognized by LDL receptors in peripheral tissues Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100 many LDL receptors concentrate in clathrincoated pits Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via endocytosis These vesicles then fuse with a lysosome where the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell so as to not interfere with the cell membranes LDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption and its synthesis is regulated by SREBP the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol de novo according to its presence inside the cell A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked to prevent new cholesterol in LDL molecules from being taken up Conversely LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol When this process becomes unregulated LDL molecules without receptors begin to appear in the blood These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by macrophages which become engorged and form foam cells These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis carotid intimamedia thickness These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks strokes and other serious medical problems leading to the association of socalled LDL cholesterol actually a lipoprotein with bad cholesterol HDL particles are thought to transport cholesterol back to the liver either for excretion or for other tissues that synthesize hormones in a process known as reverse cholesterol transport RCT Large numbers of HDL particles correlates with better health outcomes whereas low numbers of HDL particles is associated with atheromatous disease progression in the arteries Metabolism recycling and excretion Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives known as oxysterols Three different mechanisms can form these autoxidation secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation and cholesterolmetabolizing enzyme oxidation A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis This finding became known as the ‚Äúoxysterol hypothesis‚Äù Additional roles for oxysterols in human physiology include their participation in bile acid biosynthesis function as transport forms of cholesterol and regulation of gene transcription In biochemical experiments radiolabelled forms of cholesterol such as tritiatedcholesterol are used These derivatives undergo degradation upon storage and it is essential to purify cholesterol prior to use Cholesterol can be purified using small Sephadex LH20 columns Cholesterol is oxidized by the liver into a variety of bile acids These in turn are conjugated with glycine taurine glucuronic acid or sulfate A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids along with cholesterol itself is excreted from the liver into the bile Approximately 95 of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines and the remainder are lost in the feces The excretion and reabsorption of bile acids forms the basis of the enterohepatic circulation which is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats Under certain circumstances when more concentrated as in the gallbladder cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstones lecithin and bilirubin gallstones also occur but less frequently Every day up to 1 g of cholesterol enters the colon This cholesterol originates from the diet bile and desquamated intestinal cells and can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces A cholesterolreducing bacterium origin has been isolated from human feces Although cholesterol is a steroid generally associated with mammals the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to completely degrade this molecule and contains a large number of genes that are regulated by its presence Many of these cholesterolregulated genes are homologues of fatty acid Œ≤oxidation genes but have evolved in such a way as to bind large steroid substrates like cholesterol Research Cholesterol binds to and affects the gating of a number of ion channels such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor GABAA receptor and the inwardrectifier potassium ion channel Cholesterol also activates the estrogenrelated receptor alpha ERRŒ± and may be the endogenous ligand for the receptor The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be explained by the fact that cholesterol is ubiquitous in the body Inhibition of ERRŒ± signaling by reduction of cholesterol production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of statins and bisphosphonates on bone muscle and macrophages On the basis of these findings it has been suggested that the ERRŒ± should be deorphanized and classified as a receptor for cholesterol Clinical significance Hypercholesterolemia   According to the lipid hypothesis since cholesterol like all fat molecules is transported around the body in the water outside cells inside lipoprotein particles elevated cholesterol concentrations hypercholesterolemia\\xa0‚Äî potentially offers a lower cost way to estimate concentrations of LDL particles possibly even low concentrations of functional HDL particles\\xa0‚Äî both variations strongly associated with cardiovascular disease because LDL particles promote atheroma development in arteries atherosclerosis This atherosclerotic disease process over decades leads to myocardial infarction heart attack stroke and peripheral vascular disease Since higher blood LDL especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles LDL particles are often termed bad cholesterol because they have been linked to atheroma formation On the other hand high concentrations of functional HDL which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma offer protection and are sometimes referred to as good cholesterol These balances are mostly genetically determined but can be changed by body build medications food choices and other factors Conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles especially small dense LDL sdLDL particles are associated with atheroma formation in the walls of arteries a condition known as atherosclerosis which is the principal cause of coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease In contrast HDL particles especially large HDL have been identified as a mechanism by which cholesterol and inflammatory mediators can be removed from atheroma Increased concentrations of HDL correlate with lower rates of atheroma progressions and even regression A 2007 study pooling data on almost 900000 subjects in 61 cohorts demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality with the association more pronounced in younger subjects Still because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population the impact of high cholesterol on health is still larger in older people Elevated levels of the lipoprotein fractions LDL IDL and VLDL are regarded as atherogenic prone to cause atherosclerosis Levels of these fractions rather than the total cholesterol level correlate with the extent and progress of atherosclerosis Conversely the total cholesterol can be within normal limits yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles under which conditions atheroma growth rates would still be high Recently a post hoc analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol adjusted for apolipoprotein AI and apolipoprotein B and increased risk of cardiovascular disease casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of good cholesterol Elevated cholesterol levels are treated with a strict diet consisting of low saturated fat trans fatfree low cholesterol foods often followed by one of various hypolipidemic agents such as statins fibrates cholesterol absorption inhibitors nicotinic acid derivatives or bile acid sequestrants Extreme cases have previously been treated with partial ileal bypass surgery which has now been superseded by medication Apheresisbased treatments are still used for very severe hyperlipidemias that are either unresponsive to treatment or require rapid lowering of blood lipids There are several international guidelines on the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia Multiple human trials using HMGCoA reductase inhibitors known as statins have repeatedly confirmed that changing lipoprotein transport patterns from unhealthy to healthier patterns significantly lowers cardiovascular disease event rates even for people with cholesterol values currently considered low for adults Studies have also found that statins reduce atheroma progression As a result people with a history of cardiovascular disease may derive benefit from statins irrespective of their cholesterol levels total cholesterol below 50\\xa0mmolL 193\\xa0mgdL and in men without cardiovascular disease there is benefit from lowering abnormally high cholesterol levels primary prevention Primary prevention in women was originally practiced only by extension of the findings in studies on men since in women none of the large statin trials conducted prior to 2007 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in overall mortality or in cardiovascular endpoints In 2008 a large clinical trial reported that in apparently healthy adults with increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker highsensitivity Creactive protein but with low initial LDL 20\\xa0mgday of rosuvastatin for 19 years resulted in a 44 reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events and a 20 reduction in allcause mortality the effect was statistically significant for both genders Though this result was met with some skepticism later studies and metaanalyses likewise demonstrated statistically significant but smaller reductions in allcause and cardiovascular mortality without significant heterogeneity by gender The 1987 report of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panels suggests the total blood cholesterol level should be lt 200\\xa0mgdL normal blood cholesterol 200‚Äì239\\xa0mgdL borderlinehigh gt 240\\xa0mgdL high cholesterol The American Heart Association provides a similar set of guidelines for total fasting blood cholesterol levels and risk for heart disease However as todays testing methods determine LDL bad and HDL good cholesterol separately this simplistic view has become somewhat outdated The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 130\\xa0mgdL 26 mmolL although a newer upper limit of 70\\xa0mgdL 18\\xa0mmolL can be considered in higherrisk individuals based on some of the abovementioned trials A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL‚Äîanother useful measure‚Äîof far less than 51 is thought to be healthier  Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL LDL and VLDL Usually only the total HDL and triglycerides are measured For cost reasons the VLDL is usually estimated as onefifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula or a variant estimated LDL  total cholesterol ‚àí total HDL ‚àí estimated VLDL VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by five Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400\\xa0mgdL The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400\\xa0mgdL Given the wellrecognized role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease some studies have shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes In the Framingham Heart Study in subjects over 50 years of age they found an 11 increase overall and 14 increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1\\xa0mgdL per year drop in total cholesterol levels The researchers attributed this phenomenon to the fact that people with severe chronic diseases or cancer tend to have belownormal cholesterol levels This explanation is not supported by the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Programme in which men of all ages and women over 50 with very low cholesterol were likely to die of cancer liver diseases and mental diseases This result indicates the lowcholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a proxy or marker for frailty occurring with age Although the vast majority of doctors and medical scientists consider that there is a link between cholesterol and atherosclerosis as discussed above a 2014 metaanalysis of over 500000 patients concluded there is insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats for cardiovascular health Hypocholesterolemia Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed hypocholesterolemia Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited but some studies suggest a link with depression cancer and cerebral hemorrhage In general the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence rather than a cause of an underlying illness A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes SmithLemliOpitz syndrome which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels Hyperthyroidism or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the LDL receptor may result in hypocholesterolemia Cholesterol testing The American Heart Association recommends testing cholesterol every 4‚Äì6 years for people aged 20 years or older A separate set of American Heart Association guidelines issued in 2013 indicates that patients taking statin medications should have their cholesterol tested 4‚Äì12 weeks after their first dose and then every 3‚Äì12 months thereafter A blood sample after 12hour fasting is taken by a doctor or a home cholesterolmonitoring device is used to determine a lipoprotein profile This measures total cholesterol LDL bad cholesterol HDL good cholesterol and triglycerides It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 52\\xa0mmolL or more 200\\xa0mgdL or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL good cholesterol less than 1\\xa0mmolL 40\\xa0mgdL or there are other risk factors for heart

       "  'raw page text': 'Dicopper chloride trihydroxide is the chemical compound with the formula Cu2OH3Cl It is often referred to as tribasic copper chloride TBCC copper trihydroxyl chloride or copper hydroxychloride It is a greenish crystalline solid encountered in mineral deposits metal corrosion products industrial products art and archeological objects and some living systems It was originally manufactured on an industrial scale as a precipitated material used as either a chemical intermediate or a fungicide Since 1994 a purified crystallized product has been produced at the scale of thousands of tons per year and used extensively as a nutritional supplement for animals    Natural occurrence Cu2OH3Cl occurs as natural minerals in four polymorphic crystal forms atacamite paratacamite clinoatacamite and botallackite Atacamite is orthorhombic paratacamite is rhombohedral and the other two polymorphs are monoclinic Atacamite and paratacamite are common secondary minerals in areas of copper mineralization and frequently form as corrosion products of Cubearing metals The most common Cu2OH3Cl polymorph is atacamite It is an oxidation product of other copper minerals especially under arid saline conditions It was found in fumarolic deposits and a weathering product of sulfides in subsea black smoker deposits It was named for the Atacama Desert in Chile Its color varies from blackish to emerald green It is the sugarlike coating of dark green glistening crystals found on many bronze objects from Egypt and Mesopotamia It has also been found in living systems such as the jaws of the marine bloodworm Glycera dibranchiate The stability of atacamite is evidenced by its ability to endure dynamic regimes in its natural geologic environment Paratacamite is another Cu2OH3Cl polymorph that was named for the Atacama Desert in Chile It has been identified in the powdery lightgreen corrosion product that forms on a copper or bronze surface ‚Äì at times in corrosion pustules It can be distinguished from atacamite by the rhombohedral shape of its crystals Botallackite is the least stable of the four Cu2OH3Cl polymorphs It is pale bluishgreen in color This rare mineral was first found and later identified in the Botallack mine in Cornwall England It is also a rare corrosion product on archaeological finds For instance it was identified on an Egyptian statue of Bastet The fourth polymorph of Cu2OH3Cl family is clinoatacamite It was found and identified around in Chuquicamata Chile in 1996 It was named in allusion to its monoclinic morphology and relationship to atacamite It too is pale green but has monoclinic crystals Clinoatacamite can be easily confused with the closely related paratacamite It is believed that clinoatacamite should replace most previously reported occurrences of paratacamite in the conservation literature Structure Atacamite is orthorhombic space group Pnma with two crystallographically independent Cu and hydroxyl oxygen atoms in the asymmetric unit Both Cu atoms display characteristically JahnTeller distorted octahedral 42 coordination geometry each Cu is bonded to four nearest OH groups with CuOH distance of 201√Ö in addition one of Cu atoms is bonded to two Cl atoms at 276√Ö to form a CuOH4Cl2 octahedron and the other Cu atom is bonded to one Cl atom at 275√Ö and a distant OH group at 236√Ö to form a CuOH5Cl octahedron The two different types of octahedron are edgelinked to form a threedimensional framework with the CuOH5Cl octahedron crosslinking the CuOH4Cl2 octahedron layers parallel to 110 Figure 1  Botallackite crystallizes in monoclinic with space group P21m Like in atacamite there are two different types of Cu coordination geometries JahnTeller distorted octahedral CuOH4Cl2 and CuOH5Cl But these octahedra assemble in different ways Each octahedron shares six edges with surrounding octahedra forming a twodimensional sheettype structure parallel to 100 The adjacent sheets are held together by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl oxygen atoms of one sheet and the opposing chlorine atoms in the other sheets The resulting weak bonding between the sheets accounts for the perfect 100 cleavage and the typical platy habit of botallackite Figure 2  Paratacamite is rhombohedral space group R3 It has a welldeveloped substructure with a‚Äôa2 c‚Äôc apparent space group R3m There are four crystallographically independent Cu atoms in the asymmetric unit The Cu atoms display three different types of octahedral coordination geometries Three quarters of the Cu atoms are coordinated to four near OH groups and two distant Cl atoms giving the expected 42 configuration CuOH4Cl2 Three sixteenths of the Cu atoms are bonded to two near OH groups at 193√Ö and four stretched OH groups at 220√Ö to form an axially compressed 24 octahedral CuOH6 and the remaining one sixteenth of the Cu atoms are bonded to six equivalent OH groups at 212√Ö to form a regular octahedral CuOH6 The JahnTeller distorted CuOH4Cl2 octahedra share the edges and form partially occupied layers parallel to 001 and the compressed and regular CuOH6 octahedra crosslink the adjacent CuOH4Cl2 octahedral layers to form a threedimensional framework The existence of the regular octahedral CuOH6 is unusual and it has been shown that partial substitution of Zn or Ni for Cu at this special site 3b is necessary to stabilize paratacamite structure at ambient temperature Due to the high symmetry of the special position only about 2 wt Zn is necessary to stabilize the rhombohedral structure In fact most of paratacamite crystals studied contain significant amounts of Zn or Ni gt2 wt Figure 3  Clinoatacamite is monoclinic space group P21m The structure is very close to that of paratacamite But the CuOH6 octahedron is JahnTeller distorted The JahnTeller distorted CuOH4Cl2 octahedra share the edges to form partially occupied layers parallel to 101 This layer is topologically the same as that in mica Adjacent layers of octahedra are offset such that vacant sites in one sheet align with occupied sites in the neighboring sheet The CuOH6 octahedra link the layers to form a 3dimensional network Figure 4  Thermodynamic data based on the free energy of formation indicates that the order of stability of these polymorphs is clinoatacamitegtatacamitegt botallackite Spectroscopic studies show that the strength of hydrogen bonding in these polymorphs is in the order paratacamite gtatacamitegt botallackite Studies on the formation of basic copper chloride indicate botallackite is a key intermediate and crystallizes first under most conditions subsequent recrystallization of botallackite to atacamite or paratacamite depends on the nature of reaction medium Properties Dicopper chloride trihydroxide Cu2OH3Cl is a green crystalline solid It decomposes above 220\\xa0¬∞C with elimination of hydrochloric acid to oxides of copper It is largely stable in neutral media but decomposes by warming in alkaline media yielding oxides It is virtually insoluble in water and organic solvents soluble in mineral acids yielding the corresponding copper salts eq 1 soluble in ammonia amine and EDTA solutions under complex formation It can easily be converted to copper hydroxide by reacting with sodium hydroxide eq 2 Its pH in water is 69 measured by EPA method SW8469045 Cu2OH3Cl

CuCl2 solution with freshly precipitated CuO eq 4 CuCl2  3 CuO  3 H2O ‚Üí 2 Cu2OH3Cl eq4 If sufficient chloride ions are present in solution hydrolysis of CuSO4 with alkali also produces Cu2OH3Cl eq 5 2 CuSO4  3 NaOH  NaCl ‚Üí Cu2OH3Cl  2 Na2SO4 eq5 Industrial production Air oxidation of CuICl in brine solution Prior to 1994 large scale industrial production of basic copper chloride was devoted to making either a fungicide for crop protection or an intermediate in the manufacture of other copper compounds In neither of those applications was the polymorphic nature of the compound or the size of individual particles of particular importance so the manufacturing processes were simple precipitation schemes Cu2OH3Cl can be prepared by air oxidation of CuICl in brine solution The CuICl solution is usually made by reduction of CuCl2 solutions over copper metal A CuCl2 solution with concentrated brine is contacted with copper metal until the CuII is completely reduced The resulting CuICl is then heated to 60  90\\xa0¬∞C and aerated to effect the oxidation and hydrolysis The oxidation reaction can be performed with or without the copper metal The precipitated product is separated and the mother liquor containing CuCl2 and NaCl is recycled back to the process eq 6  7 CuCl2  Cu  2 NaCl ‚Üí 2 NaCuCl2 eq6 6 NaCuCl2  32 O2  H2O ‚Üí 2 Cu2OH3Cl  2 CuCl2  6 NaCl eq7 The product from this process is of fine particle with size of 1  5\\xa0¬µm and is usable as an agricultural fungicide Micronutrients process In 1994 an unusually efficient economic reliable and green process was developed for commercial production of a purified and crystallized form of tribasic copper chloride It results in a stable freeflowing nondusty green powder with typical particle size of 30  100 micron The combination of its density and particle size distribution results in blending and handling characteristics beneficial in preparation of uniform animal feed mixtures Initially that new process was designed to utilize spent etchant streams from the electronic printed circuit board manufacturing industry as starting materials There are two types of spent etching solutions from printed circuit board manufacturing operations an acidic cupric chloride solution CuCl2HCl and an alkaline cuprammine chloride solution CuNH34Cl2 Tribasic copper chloride is generated by neutralization of either one of these two solutions acidic or alkaline pathway or by combination of these two solutions a selfneutralization reaction In the acidic pathway the cupric chloride solution can be neutralized with caustic soda or ammonia lime or other base In the alkaline pathway cuprammine chloride solution can be neutralized with HCl or other available acidic solutions eq 8 2 CuNH34Cl2  5 HCl  3 H2O ‚Üí Cu2OH3Cl  8 NH4Cl eq 8 More efficiently the two spent etching solutions are combined under mild acidic conditions one neutralizing the other to produce higher yield of basic copper chloride eq 9 3 CuNH34Cl2  5 CuCl2  12 H2O ‚Üí 4 Cu2OH3Cl  12 NH4Cl eq 9 Seeding is introduced during crystallization The production is operated continuously under welldefined conditions pH feeding rate concentrations temperature etc Product with good particle size is produced and can be easily separated from background salt and other impurities in the mother liquor After simple rinse with water and drying pure freeflowing nondusty green crystalline solid with typical particle size of 30  100 micron is obtained The product from this process is predominantly atacamite and paratacamite the stable crystal forms of basic copper chloride ‚Äì and is called alpha basic copper chloride for simplicity Careful control of process conditions to favor the alpha polymorphs results in a product that remains free flowing over extended storage times thus avoiding caking as occurs with both copper sulfate and the botallackite crystal form  also called beta basic copper chloride This process has been used to manufacture thousands of tons of tribasic copper chloride every year and has been the predominant route of commercial production since it was introduced by Micronutrients in 1994 Applications As an agriculture fungicide Fine Cu2OH3Cl has been used as a fungicidal spray on tea orange grape rubber coffee cardamom and cotton etc and as an aerial spray on rubber for control of phytophthora attack on leaves As a pigment Basic copper chloride has been used as a pigment and as a colorant for glass and ceramics It was widely used as a coloring agent in wall painting manuscript illumination and other paintings by ancient people It was also used in cosmetics by ancient Egyptians In pyrotechnics Cu2OH3Cl has been used as a bluegreen coloring agents in pyrotechnics As a catalyst Cu2OH3Cl has been used in the preparation of catalysts and as a catalyst in organic synthesis for chlorination andor oxidation Cu2OH3Cl has been shown to be a catalyst in the chlorination of ethylene Atacamite and paratacamite crystal forms of Cu2OH3Cl have been found to be active species in supported CuCl2 catalyst systems for the oxidative carbonylation of methanol to dimethyl carbonate A number of supported Cu2OH3Cl catalysts have also been prepared and studied in such conversion Dimethyl carbonate is an environmentally benign chemical product and unique intermediate with versatile chemical reactivity Cu2OH3Cl has been identified as a new catalytically active material for the partial oxidation of nbutane to maleic anhydride A mixture of ultrafine powder CuOCu2OH3Cl has been shown to be good in photocatalytic decolorization of dyes such as amido black and indigo carmine As a commercial feed supplement Copper is one of the most critically important of the trace minerals that are essential elements in numerous enzymes that support metabolic functions in most organisms Since the early 1900s copper has routinely been added to animal feedstuffs to support good health and normal development Starting in the 1950s there was increasing focus on the issue of bioavailability of trace mineral supplements which led to copper sulfate pentahydrate becoming the predominant source Because of its high water solubility and thus hygroscopicity CuSO4 leads to destructive reactions in feed mixtures These are notoriously destructive in hot humid climates Recognition that basic copper chloride would reduce feed stability problems led to issuance of patents on the use of the compound as a nutritional source Subsequently animal feeding studies revealed that the alpha crystal form of basic copper chloride has a rate of chemical reactivity that is well matched to biological processes The strength of the bonds holding copper in the alpha crystal polymorphs could prevent undesirable antinutritive interactions with other feed ingredients while delivering controlled amounts of copper throughout the active zones in the digestive tract of an animal Success in producing alpha basic copper chloride on a large scale allowed for the widespread application of basic copper chloride in the feed thereby supplying the copper requirements of all major livestock groups This form of the compound has proven to be particularly suitable as a commercial feed supplement for use in livestock and aquaculture due to its inherent chemical and physical characteristics Compared to copper sulfate the alpha crystal form of basic copper chloride provides many benefits including improved feed stability less oxidative destruction of vitamins and other essential feed ingredients superior blending in feed mixtures and reduced handing costs It has been widely used in feed formulations for most species including chickens turkeys pigs beef and dairy cattle horses pets aquaculture and exotic zoo animals References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Dietary factors are recognized as having a significant effect on the risk of cancers with different dietary elements both increasing and reducing risk Diet and obesity may be related to up to 3035 of cancer deaths while physical inactivity appears to be related to 7 risk of cancer occurrence One review in 2011 suggested that total caloric intake influences cancer incidence and possibly progression While many dietary recommendations have been proposed to reduce the risk of cancer few have significant supporting scientific evidence Obesity and drinking alcohol are confirmed causes of cancer Lowering the drinking of beverages sweetened with sugar is recommended as a measure to address obesity A diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat has been implicated but not confirmed and the effect may be small for wellnourished people who maintain a healthy weight Some specific foods are linked to specific cancers Studies have linked eating red or processed meat to an increased risk of breast cancer colon cancer prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer which may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in foods cooked at high temperatures Aflatoxin B1 a frequent food contaminate causes liver cancer but drinking coffee is associated with a reduced risk Betel nut chewing causes oral cancer Pickled vegetables are directly linked to increased risks of several cancers The differences in dietary practices may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries For example stomach cancer is more common in Japan due to its highsalt diet and colon cancer is more common in the United States Immigrant communities tend to develop the risk of their new country often within one generation suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include weight management and eating mainly vegetables fruit whole grains and fish and a reduced intake of red meat animal fat and refined sugar    Types of diet Restrictive diets A number of diets and dietbased regimes are claimed to be useful against cancer Popular types of anticancer diet include the Breuss diet Gerson therapy the Budwig protocol and the macrobiotic diet None of these diets has been found to be effective and some of them have been found to be harmful Dietary patterns Nutritional epidemiologists use multivariate statistics such as principal components analysis and factor analysis to measure how patterns of dietary behavior influence the risk of developing cancer The most wellstudied dietary pattern is the mediterranean diet Based on their dietary pattern score epidemiologists categorize people into quantiles To estimate the influence of dietary behavior on risk of cancer they measure the association between quantiles and the distribution of cancer prevalence in casecontrol studies and cancer incidence in longitudinal studies They usually include other variables in their statistical model to account for the other differences between people with and without cancer confounders For breast cancer there is a replicated trend for women with a more prudent or healthy diet ie higher in fruits and vegetables to have a lower risk of cancer A drinker dietary pattern is also associated with higher breast cancer risk while the association is inconsistent between a more westernized diet and elevated risk of breast cancer Pickled foods claims direct link with cancer Dietary components Alcohol  Alcohol is associated with an increased risk of a number of cancers 36 of all cancer cases and 35 of cancer deaths worldwide are attributable to drinking of alcohol Breast cancer in women is linked with alcohol intake Alcohol also increases the risk of cancers of the mouth esophagus pharynx and larynx colorectal cancer liver cancer stomach and ovaries The International Agency for Research on Cancer Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer of the World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen Its evaluation states There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in humans ‚Ä¶Alcoholic beverages are carcinogenic to humans Group 1 Processed and red meat On October 26 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization reported that eating processed meat eg bacon ham hot dogs sausages or red meat was linked to some cancers Fiber fruits and vegetables The evidence on the effect of dietary fiber on the risk of colon cancer is mixed with some types of evidence showing a benefit and others not Eating fruit and vegetables while it has a benefit has less benefit on reducing cancer than once thought A 2014 study found fruit but not vegetables protected against upper gastrointestinal tract cancer While fruit vegetable and fiber protected against colorectal cancer and fiber protected against liver cancer Flavonoids Flavonoids specifically flavonoids such as the catechins are the most common group of polyphenolic compounds in the human diet and are found ubiquitously in plants While some studies have suggested flavonoids may have a role in cancer prevention others have been inconclusive or suggested they may be harmful Mushrooms According to Cancer Research UK there is currently no evidence that any type of mushroom or mushroom extract can prevent or cure cancer although research into some species continues Nutrient bioactives According to the American Cancer Society although laboratory research has shown the possibility of some connection between soybeans and cancer as yet there is no conclusive evidence about the anticancer effect of soy on human beings Laboratory experiments have found that turmeric might have an anticancer effect Although trials are ongoing large doses would need to be taken for any effect It is not known what in any positive effect turmeric has for human beings with cancer Although green tea has been promoted for its anticancer effect research into it has produced mixed results it is not known if it helps people prevent or treat cancer A review of all published studies by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011 concluded it is very unlikely that green tea prevents any kind of cancer in humans Resveratrol has shown anticancer activity in laboratory experiments but as of 2009 there is no evidence of an effect on cancer in humans Vitamin D supplements have been widely marketed on the internet and elsewhere for their claimed anticancer properties There is however insufficient evidence to recommend that vitamin D be prescribed for people with cancer although there is some evidence that hypovitaminosis D may be associated with a worse outcome for some cancers A 2014 systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found no firm evidence that vitamin D supplementation decreases or increases cancer occurrence in predominantly elderly communitydwelling women Mechanisms of action Methionine metabolism  Although numerous cellular mechanisms are involved in food intake many investigations over the past decades have pointed out defects in the methionine metabolic pathway as cause of carcinogenesis For instance deficiencies of the main dietary sources of methyl donors methionine and choline lead to the formation of liver cancer in rodents Methionine is an essential amino acid that must be provided by dietary intake of proteins or methyl donors choline and betaine found in beef eggs and some vegetables Assimilated methionine is transformed in Sadenosyl methionine SAM which is a key metabolite for polyamine synthesis eg spermidine and cysteine formation see the figure on the right Methionine breakdown products are also recycled back into methionine by homocysteine remethylation and methylthioadenosine MTA conversion see the figure on the right Vitamins B6 B12 folic acid and choline are essential cofactors for these reactions SAM is the substrate for methylation reactions catalyzed by DNA RNA and protein methyltransferases  The products of these reactions are methylated DNA RNA or proteins and Sadenosylhomocysteine SAH SAH has a negative feedback on its own production as an inhibitor of methyltransferase enzymes Therefore SAMSAH ratio directly regulates cellular methylation whereas levels of vitamins B6 B12 folic acid and choline regulates indirectly the methylation state via the methionine metabolism cycle A near ubiquitous feature of cancer is a maladaption of the methionine metabolic pathway in response to genetic or environmental conditions resulting in depletion of SAM andor SAMdependent methylation Whether it is deficiency in enzymes such as methylthioadenosine phosphorylase methioninedependency of cancer cells high levels of polyamine synthesis in cancer or induction of cancer through a diet deprived of extrinsic methyl donors or enhanced in methylation inhibitors tumor formation is strongly correlated with a decrease in levels of SAM in mice rats and humans According to a 2012 review the effect of methionine restriction on cancer has yet to be studied directly in humans and there is still insufficient knowledge to give reliable nutritional advice Signaling pathways Multiple oncogenic signaling pathways have been involved in the processes of cancer cell invasion and metastasis Among these signaling pathways Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways are involved in the embryonic development in the biology of cancer stem cells CSCs and in the acquisition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition EMT See also  References  External links Diet healthy eating and cancer infocancerresearchukorg Cancer Research UK\\xa0 EPIC European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and

       "  'raw page text': 'Senior dog food diets are pet foods that are catered toward the senior or mature pet population The senior dog population consists of dogs that are over the age of seven for most dog breeds though in general large and giant breed dogs tend to reach this life stage earlier when compared to smaller breed dogs who are considered senior at a much later age Senior dog foods contain nutrients and characteristics that are used to improve the health of the aging dog Aging in dogs causes many changes to occur physiologically that will require a change in nutrient composition of their diet A major change that occurs is the decrease in energy requirements which is addressed by lowered caloric content of senior pet foods Although energy requirements decrease protein requirements increase as the dog ages Senior dog foods include a higher protein content as well as highly digestible protein sources to deal with this Nutrients included for joint and bone health include glucosamine chondroitin omega3 fatty acids as well as two main minerals calcium and phosphorus Sources of fiber included in senior dog foods include beet pulp and flax seed as well as fructooligosaccharides FOS and mannanoligosaccharides MOS These act to increase gastrointestinal health Brain and cognitive health decline as the dog ages which leads to the inclusion of vitamin E and Lcarnitine in senior dog diets to combat this decline Skin and coat health can also decline in older dogs due to various reasons The inclusion of linoleic acid as well as vitamin A into senior dog diets helps to improve or maintain the skin and coat of senior dogs Immune system health is important to maintain in older dogs to prevent the development of various diseases By including omega3 and omega6 fatty acids vitamin E Œ≤carotene as well as pre and probiotics the immune system can be boosted and maintained to help improve overall health    Energy demand The maintenance energy requirement MER or the energy that is required to maintain normal activity decreases significantly as a result of lean body mass loss in aging dogs The MER can decrease by up to 25 as dogs age due to this loss Basal metabolic rate is maintained by lean mass energy expenditure which accounts for 96 of the function of lean mass The metabolizable energy or the amount of available energy which is left after the losses in urine feces and combustable gas is subtracted can be found on the food bag or calculated using the modified Atwater equation ME kcalkg  1035 x Crude Protein  85 x Crude Fiber  35 x Nitrogen Free Extract This equation takes into consideration the amount of energy availability from crude protein crude fiber and the nitrogen free extract from pet foods in order to calculate the amount of energy the animal is receiving from the food It is important to consider the metabolizable energy content of senior or mature pet foods using this equation as energy requirements will vary with age Protein  A dogs requirements for protein increases as a result of a reduced ability to synthesize proteins as it ages As a result it is extremely important to not restrict protein consumption to a senior dog as it can be as just as harmful as protein deficiency in young dogs To ensure good health it is important to provide dogs with the 22 amino acids which they require Of these 22 amino acids 12 can be synthesized The rest must be provided by good sources of dietary protein in adequate quantities Good sources of protein include eggs and fish which have a high biological value This value describes the percentage of usable amino acids within the protein It has been recommended that a minimum of 255 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be fed daily to ensure that protein requirements are met It is important to understand that protein requirements based on weight are variable and that many factors influence the protein requirements of each senior dog Bone and joint health Joint deterioration occurs as dogs age As their joints become less lubricated there is increased friction between the bone and the cartilage With this increased friction the cartilage deteriorates and wears away The reduction of this cushion in the joints causes boneonbone contact to occur causing the animal great discomfort This can cause various related issues such as altered gaits and changes in activity levels resulting in a greater possibility of obesity and other conditions related to mobility and activity levels  There has been research done in human medicine that indicates the positive effect that a combination of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine can have on moderatetosevere knee pain This effect is likely very similar to the effect these two ingredients have on the joints of aging dogs It is important to note the effects of these supplements is not instant and the aforementioned studies showed approximately a 3month period between the beginning of supplementation and the reduction of symptoms \\xa0 Glucosamine  Glucosamine is a building block for the synthesis of cartilage tissue It is found naturally in the body mainly in the fluid which surrounds the joints This can help aging joints by maintaining the cartilage thus reducing the pain caused by boneonbone contact within the joint this is the primary source of joint pain in aging animals This will increase the mobility of the dog which is vital for the maintenance of a healthy weight and general body function There have also been some studies which have showed antiinflammatory properties of glucosamine which would also help joint function in aging dogs Glucosamine is usually provided in supplements in the form of glucosamine sulfate or by the inclusion of chicken meal in the diet as it contains glucosamine as well as chondroitin Chondroitin  Chondroitin is a major component in the composition of cartilage It helps the cartilage retain moisture lubricating the joint and allowing ease of movement of the bone across the cartilage This reduces the damage to the cartilage over time Chondroitin is produced naturally in the boy but older dogs can often benefit from a supplemental dose of chondroitin Chondroitin is commonly supplied as a supplement in the form of Chondroitin sulfate Omega3 fatty acids  Omega3 fatty acids include docosahexaenoic acid\\xa0DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid\\xa0EPA These two fatty acids have been shown to improve gait score and lameness in dogs with osteoarthritis Omega3 fatty acids have also been shown to have noticeable antiinflammatory properties It is for this reason among other benefits that they are routinely included at supplemental levels in senior dog diets A good source of omega3 fatty acids in dog foods include fish oils and other fish sources especially salmon and herring as well as flaxseed Calcium and phosphorus   One of the most basic requirements of the aging dog‚Äôs body is the requirement for maintenance of their bones In order for the bones to be able to heal from any injury or erosion as well as maintain their strength to avoid these problem they need a ready supply of calcium and phosphorus Both of these are essential nutrients according to AAFCO guidelines and should be included in a senior dog diet Calcium and Phosphorus are also very valuable in the maintenance tooth health of dogs In order for calcium to be properly absorbed into the body dogs will require another nutrient vitamin D adequate vitamin D is needed to form enough calcitriol known as the active form of vitamin D If enough is not present the body will begin to draw from stores of vitamin D within the body like the bones and teeth for its needs This can lead to bone weakening and the inability to repair bone damage Gastrointestinal health Sources of Fiber  Beet pulp  Beet pulp is a common ingredient in dog diets as it is a very versatile and useful fiber source Beet pulp provides fiber to the diet which acts as a stool hardener and aids in lower tract ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù The composition of beet pulp is such that it is an insoluble and moderately fermentable fiber This means it can add bulk to the diet as well as moisture to the stool while also supplying the animal‚Äôs cells lining the intestine with energy due to the moderate fermentation that occurs Flax seed  Flax seed is the whole seed of the flax plant which contains both soluble and insoluble fiber The insoluble fraction includes cellulose hemicellulose and lignin These components have a very good water binding capacity which aids in adding bulk into the diet of the dog This has varying benefits for dogs depending on their lifestyle In some dogs it aids in digestion by preventing constipation in others it acts to improve satiety and encourage weight loss Flaxseed is also a good source of omega3 and omega6 fatty acids which have multiple health benefits for the animal such as improving coat quality Flax seed is also one of the richest sources of alpha linoleic acid ALA ALA can be converted by the dog to DHA and EPA to carry out various functions in the body Fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharides   Fructooligosaccharides commonly known as FOS consist of many different types of indigestible oligosaccharides FOS is shown to be beneficial in providing a source of energy for the good gut bacteria in dogs Mannanoligosaccharides are also known as MOS which also have an effect on the overall gut health in dogs These compounds both contain oligosaccharides however they work in different manners Constipation prevention and treatment can be carried out by the supplementation of FOS by its subsequent effect on gut bacteria MOS works in a different manner by effecting the attachment of bad bacteria in the gut of the dog These bad bacteria attach to the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract and can cause the beginnings of pathogenic diseases MOS works to counteract these by preventing the binding of these deleterious bacteria A study carried out in dogs determined that these two compounds when supplemented together can help with overall immune function This is due to the decrease in overall bad bacteria and an increase in good bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract These two compounds also were not found to have any detrimental effects on food consumption stool quality or stool output Brain and cognitive health A dogs brain undergoes many pathological changes during the aging process Some of these changes can include damage to the DNA deoxyribonucleic acid a decrease in the amount of myelin overlay on nerve cells as well as a buildup of protein in the brain which can potentially have toxic effects Due to these physiological changes senior and aging dog can have possible impairment of proper cognition This impairment can include complex learning tasks as well as memory issues Vitamin E  The addition of Vitamin E as an antioxidant in senior dog food can have a positive effect on brain and cognitive health Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin which works to prevent oxidative damage from occurring Reactive oxygen species can develop in the brain and can have a harmful effect by causing oxidative stress on the tissues if they are not subdued by antioxidants Mitocondrial aerobic metabolism is thought to be the largest source of reactive oxidative species As the mitochondria age their function declines which causes an increase in the production of oxidative species Studies carried out in aging dogs looking at the effects of antioxidant supplemented diets have shown that older dogs supplemented with antioxidants including Vitamin E were able to correctly perform tasks more often than senior dogs whose diets were not supplemented It has also been shown that in senior dogs consuming these antioxidant enriched diets there was an increase in positive behavioural actions during the feeding period compared to senior dogs consuming diets that were not supplemented Lcarnitine  Lcarnitine is an amino acid and precursor of acetylLcarnitine which is a mitochondrial cofactor It acts to help with overall mitochondrial function as well as lipid metabolism which is an important function of mitochondria This is important as an increase in mitochondrial function will help to reduce the rates of oxidative reactions in the brain which overall decrease damage to DNA and stimulates better cognitive function Skin and coat health Several physiological changes in the senior pet can lead to a decline in skin and coat health Some of these changes include a loss of elasticity in the skin which leads to wrinkling hair follicle atrophy which can cause hair loss a decrease in oil secretion which can lead to dry and flaky skin as well as a loss of melanocytes which causes the loss of pigmentation of the hair follicles Skin and coat health is one of most noticeable aging changes due to the fact that it results in a change in appearance of the senior dog Skin and coat health are important to upkeep as dogs age and there are many components in senior dog foods that can benefit this important area of health  Linoleic acid  Linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is classified as an omega 6fatty acid Linoleic acid plays an important role in the maintenance of the water barrier of skin This helps prevent the dryness and scaly skin that occurs during the aging process Omega 6fatty acids can also have a slight antiimflammatory role Good sources of linoleic acid to look for in senior dog foods include corn oil soybean oil and poultry fat Vitamin A  Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that aids in the keratinization process of hair This process is important in maintaining a healthy coat in the aging dog and preventing the deterioration of epithelial tissues Dogs do not directly need a source of Vitamin A as they can convert betacarotene a precursor to Vitamin A into Vitamin A However Vitamin A supplementation in senior dog diets can assist senior dogs in maintaining their coats as their sebaceous activity and skin elasticity decrease Vitamin A supplements can be included in senior dogs diets however there are also other good sources of Vitamin A These include milk egg yolk and liver The inactive form of Vitamin A betacarotene can be found in high amounts in carrots Vitamin E  \\xa0Vitamin E is\\xa0a\\xa0key component found in dog foods for the skin to maintain elasticity and to replace old skin cells Due to the antioxidant mechanisms of vitamin E it can prevent the formation of free radicals and in turn may prevent cancer cells from proliferating in senior dogs\\xa0Vitamin E is found in both plant and animal products such as vegetable oil dark red vegetables and liver \\xa0Zinc\\xa0  Zinc is among one of many trace minerals recommended for dogs of all ages Dogs experience loss of elasticity and dryness of the skin as they age The addition of zinc in the diet aids in the development of collagen and wound healing and also will prevent the skin from becoming dry and flaky Senior dogs can obtain zinc in their diet through the addition of various ingredients including red meats whole grains poultry byproduct meals and fish meals \\xa0 \\xa0Copper\\xa0  Loss of hair pigmentation is a common concern for senior dogs Copper has been shown to improve coat conditions by reducing dry skin and improving the overall pigmentation of the coat Therefore copper may able to delay the natural aging process of the whitening of a dogs coat \\xa0Riboflavin  Main Article Riboflavin  Vitamin B2 also known as riboflavin plays and important role as a cofactor for the metabolism of\\xa0carbohydrates Riboflavin is commonly present in diary green vegetables eggs and meat Senior dogs require a larger amount of riboflavin for maintenance compared to that of adult dogs Deficiency symptoms include cracking dry skin and darker pigmentation in some areas of the skin including the tongue now called black tongue If the deficiency is severe enough there will be alterations in blood supply to the cornea which may lead to impaired vision and potential blindness\\xa0 Immune system health Immune functions start to decline due to compromised ability to efficiently produce various proteins and cells that are important for the bodys defense system as dogs age Free radicals can cause oxidative stress killing the cells or impairing the functional capability of the cells which leads to weakening of the immune system Therefore providing dietary antioxidants can be an effective method to prevent the oxidative stress and support the immune system Ratio of omega6 to omega3 fatty acids  Omega6 and omega3 fatty acids are very important for a strong healthy immune system and for preventing chronic disease in dogs It is crucial in pet diets that the ratio of omega6 to omega3 fatty acids is properly balanced in order to achieve optimal health It is recommended to have a ratio of 51 to 101 with there being more omega6 fatty acids than omega3s AAFCO has a maximum ratio listed of 301 For ideal health and decreased risk of lowgrade chronic inflammation it is more beneficial to have a lower ratio versus a higher one Omega3 fatty acids have antiinflammatory properties and therefore need to be supplemented in a closer ratio to omega6s which are more inflammatory Out of all of the omega3 fatty acids that could be used the most potent are found in fish oil in the forms of EPA and DHA these have the highest immunomodulatory activities Omega3 fatty acids tend to increase antioxidant requirements because they oxidize so rapidly therefore when they are in a closer ratio to omega6 fatty acids as recommended antioxidants must also be supplemented in the diet Vitamin E  Vitamin E is an antioxidant that can be supplemented in the diet in order to strengthen the effect of fatty acid supplementations This vitamin works to decrease the production of proinflammatory markers that are found in synovial fluid of the joints With the help of this antioxidant chronic inflammation can be avoided which aids senior dogs in maintaining a healthier immune system as well as helping to ease the symptoms of osteoarthritis Also formation of H 2O 2 which is a reactive oxygen species that suppress lymphocyte proliferation can be decreased by vitamin E Œ≤Carotene  Betacarotene can be found in certain vegetables and it is a highly potent antioxidants The number of Tcells is naturally decreased with age leading to compromised immune function However in old dogs supplemented with dietary betacarotene had no statistical difference in the amount of CD4 T cells when compared to younger dogs It can also enhance cellmediated immune responses and help prevent cancer Dogs supplemented with high dose of dietary betacarotene may show red discolouration of feces and staining of hair However toxicity level of betacarotene in dogs is not clearly understood as dogs can also cleave betacarotene into vitamin A in their intestines Prebiotic and probiotic   Since the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to foreign materials from ingested food a healthy microbiota in gut is very important component of the immune system Prebiotic and probiotic supplements can help maintain healthy gut flora Examples of common prebiotic ingredients in dog foods are FructooligosaccharidesFOS Mannanoligosaccharides MOS and betaglucan Examples of common probiotic ingredients in dog foods are Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus faecium See also

       "  'raw page text': 'Dietary fiber or roughage is the indigestible portion of food derived from plants It has two main components Soluble fiber which dissolves in water is readily fermented in the colon into gases and physiologically active byproducts and can be prebiotic and viscous This delays gastric emptying which in humans can result in an extended feeling of fullness Insoluble fiber which does not dissolve in water is metabolically inert and provides bulking or it can be prebiotic and metabolically ferment in the large intestine Bulking fibers absorb water as they move through the digestive system easing defecation Dietary fibers can act by changing the nature of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract and by changing how other nutrients and chemicals are absorbed Some types of soluble fiber absorb water to become a gelatinous viscous substance which is fermented by bacteria in the digestive tract Some types of insoluble fiber have bulking action and are not fermented Lignin a major dietary insoluble fiber source may alter the rate and metabolism of soluble fibers Other types of insoluble fiber notably resistant starch are fully fermented Some but not all soluble plant fibers block intestinal mucosal adherence and translocation of potentially pathogenic bacteria and may therefore modulate intestinal inflammation an effect that has been termed contrabiotic Chemically dietary fiber consists of nonstarch polysaccharides such as arabinoxylans cellulose and many other plant components such as resistant starch resistant dextrins inulin lignin chitins pectins betaglucans and oligosaccharides A position has been adopted by the US Department of Agriculture to include functional fibers as isolated fiber sources that may be included in the diet The term fiber is something of a misnomer since many types of socalled dietary fiber are not actually fibrous Food sources of dietary fiber are often divided according to whether they provide predominantly soluble or insoluble fiber Plant foods contain both types of fiber in varying degrees according to the plants characteristics Advantages of consuming fiber are the production of healthful compounds during the fermentation of soluble fiber and insoluble fibers ability via its passive hygroscopic properties to increase bulk soften stool and shorten transit time through the intestinal tract A disadvantage of a diet high in fiber is the potential for significant intestinal gas production and bloating    Definition Originally fiber was defined to be the components of plants that resist human digestive enzymes a definition that includes lignin and polysaccharides The definition was later changed to also include resistant starch along with inulin and other oligosaccharides Official definition of dietary fiber varies among different institutions Types and sources of dietary fiber Fiber contents in food Dietary fibers are found in fruits vegetables and whole grains The amount of fiber contained in common foods are in the following table Medical authorities such as the Mayo Clinic recommend adding fiberrich products to the daily diet Dietary fiber is found in plants typically eaten whole raw or cooked although fiber can be added to make dietary supplements and fiberrich processed foods Grain products have the highest fiber contents such as crude corn bran 79 g per 100 g and crude wheat bran 43 g per 100 g which are ingredients for manufactured foods Plant sources of fiber Some plants contain significant amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber For example plums and prunes have a thick skin covering a juicy pulp The skin is a source of insoluble fiber whereas soluble fiber is in the pulp Grapes also contain a fair amount of fiber Soluble fiber is found in varying quantities in all plant foods including legumes peas soybeans lupins and other beans oats rye chia and barley some fruits including figs avocados plums prunes berries ripe bananas and the skin of apples quinces and pears certain vegetables such as broccoli carrots and Jerusalem artichokes root tubers and root vegetables such as sweet potatoes and onions skins of these are sources of insoluble fiber also psyllium seed husks a mucilage soluble fiber and flax seeds nuts with almonds being the highest in dietary fiber Sources of insoluble fiber include whole grain foods wheat and corn bran legumes such as beans and peas nuts and seeds potato skins lignans vegetables such as green beans cauliflower zucchini courgette celery and nopal some fruits including avocado and unripe bananas the skins of some fruits including kiwifruit grapes and tomatoes Fiber supplements These are a few example forms of fiber that have been sold as supplements or food additives These may be marketed to consumers for nutritional purposes treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders and for such possible health benefits as lowering cholesterol levels reducing risk of colon cancer and losing weight Soluble fiber supplements may be beneficial for alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome such as diarrhea or constipation and abdominal discomfort Prebiotic soluble fiber products like those containing inulin or oligosaccharides may contribute to relief from inflammatory bowel disease as in Crohns disease ulcerative colitis and Clostridium difficile due in part to the shortchain fatty acids produced with subsequent antiinflammatory actions upon the bowel Fiber supplements may be effective in an overall dietary plan for managing irritable bowel syndrome by modification of food choices One insoluble fiber resistant starch from highamylose corn has been used as a supplement and may contribute to improving insulin sensitivity and glycemic management as well as promoting regularity and possibly relief of diarrhea One preliminary finding indicates that resistant corn starch may reduce symptoms of ulcerative colitis Inulins  Chemically defined as oligosaccharides occurring naturally in most plants inulins have nutritional value as carbohydrates or more specifically as fructans a polymer of the natural plant sugar fructose Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant sources such as chicory roots or Jerusalem artichokes for use in prepared foods Subtly sweet it can be used to replace sugar fat and flour is often used to improve the flow and mixing qualities of powdered nutritional supplements and has significant potential health value as a prebiotic fermentable fiber Inulin is advantageous because it contains 25‚Äì30 the food energy of sugar or other carbohydrates and 10‚Äì15 the food energy of fat As a prebiotic fermentable fiber its metabolism by gut flora yields shortchain fatty acids see below which increase absorption of calcium magnesium and iron resulting from upregulation of mineraltransporting genes and their membrane transport proteins within the colon wall Among other potential beneficial effects noted above inulin promotes an increase in the mass and health of intestinal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium populations Inulins primary disadvantage is its tolerance As a soluble fermentable fiber it is quickly and easily fermented within the intestinal tract which may cause gas and digestive distress at doses higher than 15 gramsday in most people Individuals with digestive diseases have benefited from removing fructose and inulin from their diet While clinical studies have shown changes in the microbiota at lower levels of inulin intake some of the health effects require higher than 15 grams per day to achieve the benefits Vegetable gums Vegetable gum fiber supplements are relatively new to the market Often sold as a powder vegetable gum fibers dissolve easily with no aftertaste In preliminary clinical trials they have proven effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome Examples of vegetable gum fibers are guar gum and acacia Senegal gum Mechanisms of action Many molecules that are considered to be dietary fiber are so because humans lack the necessary enzymes to split the glycosidic bond and they reach the large intestine Many foods contain varying types of dietary fibers all of which contribute to health in different ways Dietary fibers have three primary mechanisms bulking viscosity and fermentation Different fibers have different effects suggesting that a variety of dietary fibers contribute to overall health Some fibers contribute through one primary mechanism For instance cellulose and wheat bran provide excellent bulking effects but are minimally fermented Alternatively many dietary fibers can contribute to health through more than one of these mechanisms For instance psyllium provides bulking as well as viscosity Bulking fibers can be soluble ie psyllium or insoluble ie cellulose and hemicellulose They absorb water and can significantly increase stool weight and regularity Most bulking fibers are not fermented or are minimally fermented throughout the intestinal tract Viscous fibers thicken the contents of the intestinal tract and may attenuate the absorption of sugar reduce sugar response after eating and reduce lipid absorption notably shown with cholesterol absorption Their use in food formulations is often limited to low levels due to their viscosity and thickening effects Some viscous fibers may also be partially or fully fermented within the intestinal tract guar gum betaglucan glucomannan and pectins but some viscous fibers are minimally or not fermented modified cellulose such as methylcellulose and psyllium Fermentable fibers are consumed by the microbiota within the large intestines mildly increasing fecal bulk and producing shortchain fatty acids as byproducts with wideranging physiological activities discussion below Resistant starch inulin fructooligosaccharide and galactooligosaccharide are dietary fibers which are fully fermented These include insoluble as well as soluble fibers This fermentation impacts the expression of many genes within the large intestine which impact digestive function and lipid and glucose metabolism as well as the immune system inflammation and more Dietary fibers can change the nature of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract and can change how other nutrients and chemicals are absorbed through bulking and viscosity Some types of soluble fibers bind to bile acids in the small intestine making them less likely to reenter the body this in turn lowers cholesterol levels in the blood from the actions of cytochrome P450mediated oxidation of cholesterol Insoluble fiber is associated with reduced diabetes risk but the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown One type of insoluble dietary fiber resistant starch has been shown to directly increase insulin sensitivity in healthy people in type 2 diabetics and in individuals with insulin resistance possibly contributing to reduced risk of type 2 diabetes Not yet formally proposed as an essential macronutrient dietary fiber is nevertheless regarded as important for the diet with regulatory authorities in many developed countries recommending increases in fiber intake Physicochemical properties Dietary fiber has distinct physicochemical properties Most semisolid foods fiber and fat are a combination of gel matrices which are hydrated or collapsed with microstructural elements globules solutions or encapsulating walls Fresh fruit and vegetables are cellular materials The cells of cooked potatoes and legumes are gels filled with gelatinized starch granules The cellular structures of fruits and vegetables are foams with a closed cell geometry filled with a gel surrounded by cell walls which are composites with an amorphous matrix strengthened by complex carbohydrate fibers Particle size and interfacial interactions with adjacent matrices affect the mechanical properties of food composites Food polymers may be soluble in andor plasticized by water Water is the most important plasticizer particularly in biological systems thereby changing mechanical properties The variables include chemical structure polymer concentration molecular weight degree of chain branching the extent of ionization for electrolytes solution pH ionic strength and temperature Crosslinking of different polymers protein and polysaccharides either through chemical covalent bonds or crosslinks through molecular entanglement or hydrogen or ionic bond crosslinking Cooking and chewing food alters these physicochemical properties and hence absorption and movement through the stomach and along the intestine Dietary fiber and the upper gastrointestinal tract A slowly eaten meal will enter the absorptive phase of the gastrointestinal tract more slowly than a rapidly eaten meal of similar composition Many of the differences between low and high glycemic foods would disappear if a meal was eaten slowly The chemical and physicochemical nature lipid protein carbohydrate of the meal will also influence the gastric emptying of the food multiphase system Fatty foods and hypertonic solutions empty slowly The movement of food ie chyme along the gastrointestinal tract is typical of flow in a disperse system As chyme moves along the gastrointestinal tract polymer flow and diffusion becomes important Following a meal the stomach and upper gastrointestinal contents consist of food compounds complex lipidsmicellaraqueoushydrocolloid and hydrophobic phases hydrophilic phases solid liquid colloidal and gas bubble phases Micelles are colloidsized clusters of molecules which form in conditions as those above similar to the critical micelle concentration of detergents In the upper gastrointestinal tract these detergents consist of bile acids and di and monoacyl glycerols which solubilize triacylglycerols and cholesterol Two mechanisms bring nutrients into contact with the epithelium intestinal contractions create turbulence and convection currents direct contents from the lumen to the epithelial surface The multiple physical phases in the intestinal tract slow the rate of absorption compared to that of the suspension solvent alone Nutrients diffuse through the thin relatively unstirred layer of fluid adjacent to the epithelium Immobilizing of nutrients and other chemicals within complex polysaccharide molecules affects their release and subsequent absorption from the small intestine an effect influential on the glycemic index Molecules begin to interact as their concentration increases During absorption water must be absorbed at a rate commensurate with the absorption of solutes The transport of actively and passively absorbed nutrients across epithelium is affected by the unstirred water layer covering the microvillus membrane The presence of mucus or fiber eg pectin or guar in the unstirred layer may alter the viscosity and solute diffusion coefficient Adding viscous polysaccharides to carbohydrate meals can reduce postprandial blood glucose concentrations Wheat and maize but not oats modify glucose absorption the rate being dependent upon the particle size The reduction in absorption rate with guar gum may be due to the increased resistance by viscous solutions to the convective flows created by intestinal contractions Dietary fiber interacts with pancreatic and enteric enzymes and their substrates Human pancreatic enzyme activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources Fiber may affect amylase activity and hence the rate of hydrolysis of starch The more viscous polysaccharides extend the mouthtocecum transit time guar tragacanth and pectin being slower than wheat bran Fiber in the colon The colon may be regarded as two organs the right side cecum and ascending colon a fermenter The right side of the colon is involved in nutrient salvage so that dietary fiber resistant starch fat and protein are utilized by bacteria and the endproducts absorbed for use by the body the left side transverse descending and sigmoid colon affecting continence The presence of bacteria in the colon produces an ‚Äòorgan‚Äô of intense mainly reductive metabolic activity whereas the liver is oxidative The substrates utilized by the cecum have either passed along the entire intestine or are biliary excretion products The effects of dietary fiber in the colon are on bacterial fermentation of some dietary fibers thereby an increase in bacterial mass an increase in bacterial enzyme activity changes in the waterholding capacity of the fiber residue after fermentation Enlargement of the cecum is a common finding when some dietary fibers are fed and this is now believed to be normal physiological adjustment Such an increase may be due to a number of factors prolonged cecal residence of the fiber increased bacterial mass or increased bacterial endproducts Some nonabsorbed carbohydrates eg pectin gum arabic oligosaccharides and resistant starch are fermented to shortchain fatty acids chiefly acetic propionic and nbutyric and carbon dioxide hydrogen and methane The cecal fermentation of 40‚Äì50\\xa0g of complex polysaccharides will yield 400‚Äì500\\xa0mmol total shortchain fatty acids 240‚Äì300\\xa0mmol acetate and 80‚Äì100\\xa0mmol of both propionate and butyrate Almost all of these shortchain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon This means that fecal shortchain fatty acid estimations do not reflect cecal and colonic fermentation only the efficiency of absorption the ability of the fiber residue to sequestrate shortchain fatty acids and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted The production of shortchain fatty acids has several possible actions on the gut mucosa All of the shortchain fatty acids are readily absorbed by the colonic mucosa but only acetic acid reaches the systemic circulation in appreciable amounts Butyric acid appears to be used as a fuel by the colonic mucosa as the preferred energy source for colonic cells Dietary fiber and cholesterol metabolism Dietary fiber may act on each phase of ingestion digestion absorption and excretion to affect cholesterol metabolism such as the following Caloric energy of foods through a bulking effect Slowing of gastric emptying time A glycemic index type of action on absorption A slowing of bile acid absorption in the ileum so bile acids escape through to the cecum Altered or increased bile acid metabolism in the cecum Indirectly by absorbed shortchain fatty acids especially propionic acid resulting from fiber fermentation affecting the cholesterol metabolism in the liver Binding of bile acids to fiber or bacteria in the cecum with increased fecal loss from the enterohepatic circulation An important action of some fibers is to reduce the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum and hence the amount and type of bile acid and fats reaching the colon A reduction in the reabsorption of bile acid from the ileum has several direct effects Bile acids may be trapped within the lumen of the ileum either because of a high luminal viscosity or because of binding to a dietary fiber Lignin in fiber adsorbs bile acids but the unconjugated form of the bile acids are adsorbed more than the conjugated form In the ileum where bile acids are primarily absorbed the bile acids are predominantly conjugated The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids may be altered and there is an increased flow of bile acids to the cecum where they are deconjugated and 7alphadehydroxylated These watersoluble form bile acids eg deoxycholic and lithocholic are adsorbed to dietary fiber and an increased fecal loss of sterols dependent in part on the amount and type of fiber A further factor is an increase in the bacterial mass and activity of the ileum as some fibers eg pectin are digested by bacteria The bacterial mass increases and cecal bacterial activity increases The enteric loss of bile acids results in increased synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol which in turn reduces body cholesterol The fibers that are most effective in influencing sterol metabolism eg pectin are fermented in the colon It is therefore unlikely that the reduction in body cholesterol is due to adsorption to this fermented fiber in the colon There might be alterations in the endproducts of bile acid bacterial metabolism or the release of short chain fatty acids which are absorbed from the colon return to the liver in the portal vein and modulate either the synthesis of cholesterol or its catabolism to bile acids The prime mechanism whereby fiber influences cholesterol metabolism is through bacteria binding bile acids in the colon after the initial deconjugation and dehydroxylation Fermentable fibers eg pectin will by virtue of their providing a medium for bacterial growth increase the bacterial mass in the colon The sequestrated bile acids are then excreted in feces Other fibers eg gum arabic act as stabilizers and cause a significant decrease in serum cholesterol without increasing fecal bile acid excretion  Dietary fiber and fecal weight Feces consist of plasticinelike material made up of water bacteria lipids sterols mucus and fiber Feces are 75 water bacteria make a large contribution to the dry weight the residue being unfermented fiber and excreted compounds Fecal output may vary over a range of between 20 and 280 g over 24 hours The amount of feces egested a day varies for any one individual over a period of time Of dietary constituents only dietary fiber increases fecal weight Water is distributed in the colon in three ways Free water which can be absorbed from the colon Water that is incorporated into bacterial mass Water that is bound by fiber Fecal weight is dictated by the holding of water by the residual dietary fiber after fermentation the bacterial mass There may also be an added osmotic effect of products of bacterial fermentation on fecal mass Wheat bran is minimally fermented and binds water and when added to the diet increases fecal weight in a predictable linear manner and decreases intestinal transit time The particle size of the fiber is allimportant coarse wheat bran being more effective than fine wheat bran The greater the waterholding capacity of the bran the greater the effect on fecal weight For most healthy individuals an increase in wet fecal weight depending on the particle size of the bran is generally of the order of 3‚Äì5 gg fiber The fermentation of some fibers results in an increase in the bacterial content and possibly fecal weight Other fibers eg pectin are fermented and have no effect on stool weight Effects of fiber intake Research has shown that fiber may benefit health in several different ways Lignin and probably related materials that are resistant to enzymatic degradation diminish the nutritional value of foods Table legend Color coding of table entries Both Applies to both soluble and insoluble fiber Soluble Applies to soluble fiber only Insoluble Applies to insoluble fiber only Fiber does not bind to minerals and vitamins and therefore does not restrict their absorption but rather evidence exists that fermentable fiber sources improve absorption of minerals especially calcium Some plant foods can reduce the absorption of minerals and vitamins like calcium zinc vitamin C and magnesium but this is caused by the presence of phytate which is also thought to have important health benefits not by fiber Research A study of 388000 adults ages 50 to 71 for nine years found that the highest consumers of fiber were 22 less likely to die over this period In addition to lower risk of death from heart disease adequate consumption of fibercontaining foods especially grains was also associated with reduced incidence of infectious and respiratory illnesses and particularly among males reduced risk of cancerrelated death An experiment designed with a large sample and conducted by NIHAARP Diet and Health Study studied the correlation between fiber intake and colorectal cancer The analytic cohort consisted of 291988 men and 197623 women aged 50‚Äì71 years Diet was assessed with a selfadministered foodfrequency questionnaire at baseline in 1995‚Äì1996 2974 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified during five years of followup The result was that total fiber intake was not associated with colorectal cancer But on the other hand the analyses of fiber from different food sources showed that fiber from grains was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer Although many researchers believe that dietary fiber intake reduces risk of colon cancer one study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Medicine of over 88000 women did not show a statistically significant relationship between higher fiber consumption and lower rates of colorectal cancer or adenomas Similarly a 2010 study of 58279 men found no relationship between dietary fiber and colorectal cancer Dietary fiber and obesity Dietary fiber has many functions in diet one of which may be to aid in energy intake control and reduced risk for development of obesity The role of dietary fiber in energy intake regulation and obesity development is related to its unique physical and chemical properties that aid in early signals of satiation and enhanced or prolonged signals of satiety Early signals of satiation may be induced through cephalic and gastricphase responses related to the bulking effects of dietary fiber on energy density and palatability whereas the viscosityproducing effects of certain fibers may enhance satiety through intestinalphase events related to modified gastrointestinal function and subsequent delay in fat absorption In general fiberrich diets whether achieved through fiber supplementation or incorporation of high fiber foods into meals have a reduced energy density compared with high fat diets This is related to fiber‚Äôs ability to add bulk and weight to the diet There are also indications that women may be more sensitive to dietary manipulation with fiber than men The relationship of body weight status and fiber effect on energy intake suggests that obese individuals may be more likely to reduce food intake with dietary fiber inclusion Guidelines on fiber intake Current recommendations from the United States National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine state that for Adequate Intake adult men ages 14‚Äì50 consume 38 grams of dietary fiber per day men 51 and older 30 grams women ages 19‚Äì50 to consume 25 grams per day women 51 and older 21 grams The AND Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics previously ADA recommends a minimum of 20‚Äì35 gday for a healthy adult depending on calorie intake eg a 2000 Cal8400 kJ diet should include 25 g of fiber per day The ANDs recommendation for children is that intake should equal age in years plus 5 gday eg a 4 year old should consume 9 gday No guidelines have yet been established for the elderly or very ill Patients with current constipation vomiting and abdominal pain should see a physician Certain bulking agents are not commonly recommended with the prescription of opioids because the slow transit time mixed with larger stools may lead to severe constipation pain or obstruction The British Nutrition Foundation has recommended a minimum fiber intake of 18 gday for healthy adults Fiber recommendations United States On average North Americans consume less than 50 of the dietary fiber levels recommended for good health In the preferred food choices of todays youth this value may be as low as 20 a factor considered by experts as contributing to the obesity levels seen in many developed countries Recognizing the growing scientific evidence for physiological benefits of increased fiber intake regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration FDA of the United States have given approvals to food products making health claims for fiber The FDA classifies which ingredients qualify as being fiber and requires for product labeling that a physiological benefit is gained by adding the fiber ingredient As of 2008 the FDA approved health claims for qualified fiber products to display labeling that regular consumption may reduce blood cholesterol levels ‚Äì which can lower the risk of coronary heart disease ‚Äì and also reduce the risk of some types of cancer Viscous fiber sources gaining FDA approval are Psyllium seed husk 7\\xa0grams per day Betaglucan from oat bran whole oats oatrim or rolled oats 3\\xa0grams per day Betaglucan from whole grain or drymilled barley 3\\xa0grams per day Other examples of bulking fiber sources used in functional foods and supplements include cellulose guar gum and xanthan gum Other examples of fermentable fiber sources from plant foods or biotechnology used in functional foods and supplements include resistant starch inulin fructans fructooligosaccharides oligo or polysaccharides and resistant dextrins which may be partially or fully fermented Consistent intake of fermentable fiber may reduce the risk of chronic diseases Insufficient fiber in the diet can lead to constipation United Kingdom In June 2007 the British Nutrition Foundation issued a statement to define dietary fiber more concisely and list the potential health benefits established to date Statement Dietary fibre has been used as a collective term for a complex mixture of substances with different chemical and physical properties which exert different types of physiological effects The use of certain analytical methods to quantify dietary fiber by nature of its indigestibility results in many other indigestible components being isolated along with the carbohydrate components of dietary fiber These components include resistant starches and oligosaccharides along with other substances that exist within the plant cell structure and contribute to the material that passes through the digestive tract Such components are likely to have physiological effects Yet some differentiation has to be made between these indigestible plant components and other partially digested material such as protein that appears in the large bowel Thus it is better to classify fiber as a group of compounds with different physiological characteristics rather than to be constrained by defining it chemically end quote Diets naturally high in fiber can be considered to bring about several main physiological consequences increases fecal bulk and helps prevent constipation by decreasing fecal transit time in the large intestine reduces blood pressure improves gastrointestinal health improves glucose tolerance and the insulin response following a meal increases colonic fermentation and shortchain fatty acid production positively modulates colonic microflora reduces hyperlipidemia hypertension and other coronary heart disease risk factors reduces the risk of developing some cancers particularly colon cancer increases satiety and hence some degree of weight management Fiber is defined by its physiological impact with many heterogenous types of fibers Some fibers may primarily impact one of these benefits ie cellulose increases fecal bulking and prevents constipation but many fibers impact more than one of these benefits ie resistant starch increases bulking increases colonic fermentation positively modulates colonic microflora and increases satiety and insulin sensitivity The beneficial effects of high fiber diets are the summation of the effects of the different types of fiber present in the diet and also other components of such diets Defining fiber physiologically allows recognition of indigestible carbohydrates with structures and physiological properties similar to those of naturally occurring dietary fibers Fiber and fermentation The American Association of Cereal Chemists has defined soluble fiber this way the edible parts of plants or similar carbohydrates resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine In this definition Edible parts of plants indicates that some parts of a plant we eat‚Äîskin pulp seeds stems leaves roots‚Äîcontain fiber Both insoluble and soluble sources are in those plant components Carbohydrates complex carbohydrates such as longchained sugars also called starch oligosaccharides or polysaccharides are sources of soluble fermentable fiber Resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine foods providing nutrients are digested by gastric acid and digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine where the nutrients are released then absorbed through the intestinal wall for transport via the blood throughout the body A food resistant to this process is undigested as insoluble and soluble fibers are They pass to the large intestine only affected by their absorption of water insoluble fiber or dissolution in water soluble fiber Complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine the large intestine comprises a segment called the colon within which additional nutrient absorption occurs through the process of fermentation Fermentation occurs by the action of colonic bacteria on the food mass producing gases and shortchain fatty acids It is these shortchain fatty acids‚Äîbutyric acetic ethanoic propionic and valeric acids‚Äîthat scientific evidence is revealing to have significant health properties As an example of fermentation shorterchain carbohydrates a type of fiber found in legumes cannot be digested but are changed via fermentation in the colon into shortchain fatty acids and gases which are typically expelled as flatulence According to a 2002 journal article fiber compounds with partial or low fermentability include cellulose a polysaccharide hemicellulose a polysaccharide lignans a group of phytoestrogens plant waxes fiber compounds with high fermentability include resistant starches betaglucans a group of polysaccharides pectins a group of heteropolysaccharides natural gums a group of polysaccharides inulins a group of polysaccharides oligosaccharides Shortchain fatty acids When fermentable fiber is fermented shortchain fatty acids SCFA are produced SCFAs are involved in numerous physiological processes promoting health including stabilize blood glucose levels by acting on pancreatic insulin release and liver control of glycogen breakdown stimulate gene expression of glucose transporters in the intestinal mucosa regulating glucose absorption provide nourishment of colonocytes particularly by the SCFA butyrate suppress cholesterol synthesis by the liver and reduce blood levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides responsible for atherosclerosis lower colonic pH ie raises the acidity level in the colon which protects the lining from formation of colonic polyps and increases absorption of dietary minerals stimulate production of T helper cells antibodies leukocytes cytokines and lymph mechanisms having crucial roles in immune protection improve barrier properties of the colonic mucosal layer inhibiting inflammatory and adhesion irritants contributing to immune functions SCFAs that are absorbed by the colonic mucosa pass through the colonic wall into the portal circulation supplying the liver and the liver transports them into the general circulatory system Overall SCFAs affect major regulatory systems such as blood glucose and lipid levels the colonic environment and intestinal immune functions The major SCFAs in humans are butyrate propionate and acetate where butyrate is the major energy source for colonocytes propionate is destined for uptake by the liver and acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral tissues US FDAapproved health claims The United States FDA allows producers of foods containing 17 g per serving of psyllium husk soluble fiber or 075 g of oat or barley soluble fiber as betaglucans to claim that reduced risk of heart disease can result from their regular consumption The FDA statement template for making this claim is Soluble fiber from foods such as name of soluble fiber source and if desired name of food product as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease A serving of name of food product supplies  grams of the necessary daily dietary intake for the benefit soluble fiber from name of soluble fiber source necessary per day to have this effect Eligible sources of soluble fiber providing betaglucan include Oat bran Rolled oats Whole oat flour Oatrim Whole grain barley and dry milled barley Soluble fiber from psyllium husk with purity of no less than 95 The allowed label may state that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain of the above foods may or might reduce the risk of heart disease As discussed in FDA regulation 21 CFR 10181 the daily dietary intake levels of soluble fiber from sources listed above associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease are 3 g or more per day of betaglucan soluble fiber from either whole oats or barley or a combination of whole oats and barley 7 g or more per day of soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk Soluble fiber from consuming grains is included in other allowed health claims for lowering risk of some types of cancer and heart disease by consuming fruit and vegetables 21 CFR 10176 10177 and 10178 See also Essential nutrient List of

       "  'raw page text': 'In the context of nutrition a mineral is a chemical element required as an essential nutrient by organisms to perform functions necessary for life Minerals originate in the earth and cannot be made by living organisms Plants get minerals from soil Most of the minerals in a human diet come from eating plants and animals or from drinking water As a group minerals are one of the four groups of essential nutrients the others of which are vitamins essential fatty acids and essential amino acids The five major minerals in the human body are calcium phosphorus potassium sodium and magnesium All of the remaining elements in a human body are called trace elements The trace elements that have a specific biochemical function in the human body are sulfur iron chlorine cobalt copper zinc manganese molybdenum iodine and selenium Most chemical elements that are ingested by organisms are in the form of simple compounds Plants absorb dissolved elements in soils which are subsequently ingested by the herbivores and omnivores that eat them and the elements move up the food chain Larger organisms may also consume soil geophagia or use mineral resources such as salt licks to obtain limited minerals unavailable through other dietary sources Bacteria and fungi play an essential role in the weathering of primary elements that results in the release of nutrients for their own nutrition and for the nutrition of other species in the ecological food chain One element cobalt is available for use by animals only after having been processed into complex molecules eg vitamin B12 by bacteria Minerals are used by animals and microorganisms for the process of mineralizing structures called biomineralization used to construct bones seashells eggshells exoskeletons and mollusc shells    Essential chemical elements for humans  At least twenty chemical elements are known to be required to support human biochemical processes by serving structural and functional roles as well as electrolytes However as many as twentynine elements in total including hydrogen carbon nitrogen and oxygen are suggested to be used by mammals as inferred by biochemical and uptake studies Calcium makes up 920 to 1200 grams of adult body weight with 99 of it contained in bones and teeth Phosphorus makes up about 1 of a persons body weight The other major minerals potassium sodium chlorine sulfur and magnesium make up only about 085 of the weight of the body Together these eleven chemical elements H C N O Ca P K Na Cl S Mg make up 9985 of the body There is not scientific consensus on whether all of the elements in light green in periodic table are essential or not Most of the known and suggested mineral nutrients are of relatively low atomic weight and are reasonably common on land or at least common in the ocean iodine sodium The following play important roles in biological processes RDA  Recommended Dietary Allowance UL  Tolerable Upper Intake Level Figures shown are for adults age 3150 male or female neither pregnant nor lactating  One serving of seaweed exceeds the US Tolerable Upper Intake Level UL of 1100 Œºg but not the 3000 Œºg UL set by Japan Blood concentrations of minerals Minerals are present in a healthy human beings blood at certain mass and molar concentrations The figure below presents the concentrations of each of the chemical elements discussed in this article from centerright to the right Depending on the concentrations some are in upper part of the picture while others are in the lower part The figure includes the relative values of other constituents of blood such as hormones In the figure minerals are color highlighted in purple  Dietary nutrition Dietitians may recommend that minerals are best supplied by ingesting specific foods rich with the chemical elements of interest The elements may be naturally present in the food eg calcium in dairy milk or added to the food eg orange juice fortified with calcium iodized salt fortified with iodine Dietary supplements can be formulated to contain several different chemical elements as compounds a combination of vitamins andor other chemical compounds or a single element as a compound or mixture of compounds such as calcium as calcium carbonate calcium citrate etc or magnesium as magnesium oxide etc or iron as ferrous sulfate iron bisglycinate etc The dietary focus on chemical elements derives from an interest in supporting the biochemical reactions of metabolism with the required elemental components Appropriate intake levels of certain chemical elements have been demonstrated to be required to maintain optimal health Diet can meet all the bodys chemical element requirements although supplements can be used when some requirements eg calcium which is found mainly in dairy products are not adequately met by the diet or when chronic or acute deficiencies arise from pathology injury etc Research has supported that altering inorganic mineral compounds carbonates oxides etc by reacting them with organic ligands amino acids organic acids etc improves the bioavailability of the supplemented mineral Elements considered possibly essential but not confirmed Many ultratrace elements have been suggested as essential but such claims have usually not been confirmed Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function One problem with identifying efficacy is that some elements are innocuous at low concentrations and are pervasive examples silicon and nickel in solid and dust so proof of efficacy is lacking because deficiencies are difficult to reproduce Ultratrace elements of some minerals such as silicon and boron are known to have a role but the exact biochemical nature is unknown and others such as arsenic and chromium are suspected to have a role in health but with weaker evidence Chromium is considered and essential mineral by the US Institute of Medicine but not for the European Food Safety Authority which makes the decisions for the European Union Roles for trace minerals include enzyme catalysis attracting substrate molecules redox reactions and structural or regulatory effects on protein binding Mineral ecology Recent studies have shown a tight linkage between living organisms and chemical elements on this planet This led to the redefinition of minerals as an element or compound amorphous or crystalline formed through biogeochemical processes The addition of bio reflects a greater appreciation although an incomplete understanding of the processes of mineral formation by living forms Biologists and geologists have only recently started to appreciate the magnitude of mineral biogeoengineering Bacteria have contributed to the formation of minerals for billions of years and critically define the biogeochemical mineral cycles on this planet Microorganisms can precipitate metals from solution contributing to the formation of ore deposits in addition to their ability to catalyze mineral dissolution to respire precipitate and form minerals Most minerals are inorganic in nature Mineral nutrients refers to the smaller class of minerals that are metabolized for growth development and vitality of living organisms Mineral nutrients are recycled by bacteria that are freely suspended in the vast water columns of the worlds oceans They absorb dissolved organic matter containing mineral nutrients as they scavenge through the dying individuals that fall out of large phytoplankton blooms Flagellates are effective bacteriovores and are also commonly found in the marine water column The flagellates are preyed upon by zooplankton while the phytoplankton concentrates on the larger particulate matter that is suspended in the water column as they are consumed by larger zooplankton with fish as the top predator Mineral nutrients cycle through this marine food chain from bacteria and phytoplankton to flagellates and zooplankton which are then eaten by fish The bacteria are important in this chain because only they have the physiological ability to absorb the dissolved mineral nutrients from the sea These recycling principals from marine environments apply to many soil and freshwater ecosystems as well In terrestrial ecosystems fungi play similar roles as bacteria they mobilize nutritional elements composing matter that is inaccessible for other organisms and transport acquired nutrients to nutritionally scarce patches of ecosystem See also  Food composition Health

       "  'raw page text': 'The Dietary Reference Intake DRI is a system of nutrition recommendations from the Institute of Medicine IOM of the National Academies United States It was introduced in 1997 in order to broaden the existing guidelines known as Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs see below The DRI values differ from those used in nutrition labeling on food and dietary supplement products in the US and Canada which uses Reference Daily Intakes RDIs and Daily Values DV which were based on outdated RDAs from 1968 but were updated as of 2016 DRI provides several different types of reference values Estimated Average Requirements EAR expected to satisfy the needs of 50 of the people in that age group based on a review of the scientific literature Recommended Dietary Allowances RDA the daily dietary intake level of a nutrient considered sufficient by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine to meet the requirements of 975 of healthy individuals in each lifestage and sex group The definition implies that the intake level would cause a harmful nutrient deficiency in just 25 It is calculated based on the EAR and is usually approximately 20 higher than the EAR See Calculating the RDA Adequate Intake AI where no RDA has been established but the amount established is somewhat less firmly believed to be adequate for everyone in the demographic group Tolerable upper intake levels UL to caution against excessive intake of nutrients like vitamin A that can be harmful in large amounts This is the highest level of daily nutrient consumption that is considered to be safe for and cause no side effects in 975 of healthy individuals in each lifestage and sex group The definition implies that the intake level would cause a harmful nutrient excess in just 25 The European Food Safety Authority EFSA has also established ULs which do not always agree with US ULs For example adult zinc UL is 40\\xa0mg in US and 25\\xa0mg in EFSA Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges AMDR a range of intake specified as a percentage of total energy intake Used for sources of energy such as fats and carbohydrates The European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values with Population Reference Intake PRI instead of RDA and Average Requirement instead of EAR AI and UL defined the same as in United States but values may differ DRIs are used by both the United States and Canada and are intended for the general public and health professionals Applications include Composition of diets for schools prisons hospitals or nursing homes Industries developing new foods and dietary supplements Healthcare policy makers and public health officials    History The recommended dietary allowance RDA was developed during World War II by Lydia J Roberts Hazel Stiebeling and Helen S Mitchell all part of a committee established by the United States National Academy of Sciences in order to investigate issues of nutrition that might affect national defense The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941 after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces for civilians and for overseas population who might need food relief Roberts Stiebeling and Mitchell surveyed all available data created a tentative set of allowances for energy and eight nutrients and submitted them to experts for review Nestle 35 The final set of guidelines called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances were accepted in 1941 The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel so they included a margin of safety Because of food rationing during the war the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens nutritional intake also took food availability into account The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years In the early 1950s United States Department of Agriculture nutritionists made a new set of guidelines that also included the number of servings of each food group in order to make it easier for people to receive their RDAs of each nutrient The DRI was introduced in 1997 in order to broaden the existing system of RDAs DRIs were published over the period 1998 to 2001 In 2011 revised DRIs were published for calcium and vitamin D None of the other DRIs have been revised since first published 1998 to 2001 Current recommendations for United States

following substances not be added to food or dietary supplements Research has been conducted into adverse effects but was not conclusive in many cases Macronutrients RDAAI is shown below for males and females aged 1970 years  Calculating the RDA The equations used to calculate the RDA are as follows If the standard deviation SD of the EAR is available and the requirement for the nutrient is symmetrically distributed the RDA is set at two SDs above the EAR                         R         D         A                  E         A         R                  2         S         D

EAR of 10 percent is assumed unless available data indicate a greater variation in requirements If 10 percent is assumed to be the CV then twice that amount when added to the EAR is defined as equal to the RDA The resulting equation for the RDA is then                         R         D         A                  12         E         A         R                 displaystyle RDA12EAR    This

plenty of starch rice bread pasta and potatoes It also recommends that a person should eat at least 5 fruit or vegetable portions each day Meat fish eggs and other proteinrich foods should be eaten in moderation Dairy products should also be moderately consumed Finally salt saturated fat and sugar should be eaten least of all This advice is summarized in the eatwell guide Note that exceptions to these rules include pregnant women and young children Additionally those who have little exposure to sunlight may need to take vitamin D supplementation Sources of energy The Dietary Reference Values below are specified mainly for adults They define the proportion of a persons total energy intake which should come from different components of food These include fat and fatty acids fibre starch and sugars Note that these values do not apply to children and children younger than five with small appetites should not have such restrictions imposed Salt The guideline salt intake for adults is about

their views on fats carbohydrates fibres and water as well as FoodBased Dietary Guidelines Furthermore EFSA is searching for comments Open Consultation by 15 October in order to validate its assumptions on the need to have carbohydrates comprising 45‚Äì60 of the overall daily caloric intake fats being comprised among 20‚Äì35 of the overall caloric intake fibre needs complying with 25

       "  'raw page text': 'An essential amino acid or indispensable amino acid is an amino acid that cannot be synthesized de novo from scratch by the organism and thus must be supplied in its diet The nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are phenylalanine valine threonine tryptophan methionine leucine isoleucine lysine and histidine ie F V T W M L I K H Six other amino acids are considered conditionally essential in the human diet meaning their synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress These six are arginine cysteine glycine glutamine proline and tyrosine ie R C G Q P Y Five amino acids are dispensable in humans meaning they can be synthesized in the body These five are alanine aspartic acid asparagine glutamic acid and serine ie A D N E S    Essentiality in humans  Essential only in certain cases  Pyrrolysine sometimes considered the 22nd amino acid is not used by humans Eukaryotes can synthesize some of the amino acids from other substrates Consequently only a subset of the amino acids used in protein synthesis are essential nutrients Recommended daily intake  Estimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven to be difficult these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the last 20 years The following table lists the WHO and United States recommended daily amounts currently in use for essential amino acids in adult humans together with their standard oneletter abbreviations Food sources are identified based on the USDA National Nutrient Database Release The recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10 to 20 higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150 higher in the first year of life Cysteine or sulphurcontaining amino acids tyrosine or aromatic amino acids and arginine are always required by infants and growing children Relative amino acid composition of protein sources Various attempts have been made to express the quality or value of various kinds of protein Measures include the biological value net protein utilization protein efficiency ratio protein digestibilitycorrected amino acid score and complete proteins concept These concepts are important in the livestock industry because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in animal feeds would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on feed conversion ratio Thus various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization or a supplement of an individual amino acid methionine lysine threonine or tryptophan can be added to the feed Although proteins from plant sources tend to have relatively lower concentrations of protein by mass in comparison to protein from eggs or milk they are nevertheless complete in that they contain at least trace amounts of all of the amino acids that are essential in human nutrition Eating various plant foods in combination can provide a protein of higher biological value Certain native combinations of foods such as corn and beans soybeans and rice or red beans and rice contain the essential amino acids necessary for humans in adequate amounts Additionally certain types of algae and marine phytoplankton predate the division between animal and plant life on the planet they have both chlorophyll as do plants and also all the essential amino acids as do animal proteins Protein per calorie It can be shown that common vegetable sources contain adequate protein often more protein per Calorie than the standard reference whole raw egg while other plant sources particularly fruits contain less For example while 100 g of raw broccoli only provides 28 kcal and 3 g of protein it has over 100\\xa0mg of protein per kcal An egg contains five times as many calories 143 kcal but only four times as much protein roughly 90\\xa0mg of protein per kcal However a carrot has only 23\\xa0mg protein per kcal or twice the minimum recommendation a banana meets the minimum and an apple is below recommendation It is recommended that adult humans obtain 10‚Äì35 of their calories as protein or roughly 11‚Äì39\\xa0mg of protein per kcal per day 22‚Äì78 g for 2000 kcal The US FDA daily reference value of 50 g protein per 2000 kcal is 25\\xa0mgkcal per day Complete proteins in nonhuman animals Scientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was zein which comes from maize corn but recovered if they were fed casein from cows milk This led William Cumming Rose to the discovery of the essential amino acid threonine Through manipulation of rodent diets Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats lysine tryptophan histidine phenylalanine leucine isoleucine methionine valine and arginine in addition to threonine Roses later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings with histidine also being essential for infants Longer term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans Interchangeability The distinction between essential and nonessential amino acids is somewhat unclear as some amino acids can be produced from others The sulfurcontaining amino acids methionine and homocysteine can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized de novo in humans Likewise cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own So for convenience sulfurcontaining amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair phenylalanine and tyrosine Likewise arginine ornithine and citrulline which are interconvertible by the urea cycle are considered a single group Effects of deficiency  If one of the essential amino acids is less than needed for an individual the utilization of other amino acids will be hindered and thus protein synthesis will be less than what it usually is even in the presence of adequate total nitrogen intake Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the bodys organs and many of its systems including the brain and brain function of infants and young children the immune system thus elevating risk of infection gut mucosal function and permeability which affects absorption and vulnerability to systemic disease and kidney function The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema failure to thrive in infants and children poor musculature dull skin and thin and fragile hair Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low serum albumin and low serum transferrin The amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments

the known vitamins a large brown candy made of liver extract flavored with peppermint oil to supply any unknown vitamins and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids The main outcome measure was nitrogen balance Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness exhaustion and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid Essential amino acid deficiency should be distinguished from proteinenergy malnutrition which can manifest as marasmus or kwashiorkor Kwashiorkor was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories sugar baby syndrome However this theory has been challenged by the finding that there is no difference in the diets of children developing marasmus as opposed to kwashiorkor Still for instance in Dietary Reference Intakes DRI maintained by the USDA lack of one or more of the essential amino acids is described as proteinenergy malnutrition See also

for Research on Cancer IARC part of the World Health Organization and funded by the Europe Against Cancer programme of the European Commission as well as multiple nationspecific grants and charities 521457 healthy adults mostly aged 35‚Äì70 years were enrolled in 23 centres in ten European countries Denmark 11 France 14 Germany 10 Greece 5 Italy 9 The Netherlands 8 Norway 7 Spain 8 Sweden 10 and the United Kingdom 17 One UK centre Oxford recruited 27000 vegetarians and vegans this subgroup forms the largest study of this dietary group Recruitment to the study took place between 1993 and 1999 and follow up is planned for at least ten years with repeat interviewquestionnaires every three to five years The main prospective data collected are standardised dietary questionnaires selfadministered or interviewbased sevenday food diaries blood samples and anthropometric measurements such as body mass index and waisttohip ratio Additionally the GenAir casecontrol study is studying the relationship of passive smoking and air pollution with cancers and respiratory diseases Up to 2004 there were over 26000 new cases of cancer recorded among participants with the most common being cancers of the breast colorectum prostate and lung Current analyses are focusing particularly on stomach colorectal breast prostate and lung cancers The different dietary patterns in the different countries should enable reliable associations to be made between particular diets and cancers The analysis of stored blood samples should also allow dissection of genetic factors involved in cancers as well as the effects of hormones and hormonelike factors    Key findings The study and its analysis is ongoing but key results of the study retrieved in 2008 are Lowered sodium from salt

       "  'raw page text': 'Fat is one of the three main macronutrients along with carbohydrate and protein Fats also known as triglycerides are esters of three fatty acid chains and the alcohol glycerol The terms oil fat and lipid are often confused Oil normally refers to a fat with short or unsaturated fatty acid chains that is liquid at room temperature while fat may specifically refer to fats that are solids at room temperature Lipid is the general term though a lipid is not necessarily a triglyceride Fats like other lipids are generally hydrophobic and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water Fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions They are a necessary part of the diet of most heterotrophs including humans Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents There are two essential fatty acids EFAs in human nutrition alphalinolenic acid an omega3 fatty acid and linoleic acid an omega6 fatty acid Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lipases produced in the pancreas Fats and oils are categorized according to the number and bonding of the carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain Fats that are saturated fats have no double bonds between the carbons in the chain Unsaturated fats have one or more double bonded carbons in the chain The nomenclature is based on the nonacid noncarbonyl end of the chain This end is called the omega end or the nend Thus alphalinolenic acid is called an omega3 fatty acid because the 3rd carbon from that end is the first double bonded carbon in the chain counting from that end Some oils and fats have multiple double bonds and are therefore called polyunsaturated fats Unsaturated fats can be further divided into cis fats which are the most common in nature and trans fats which are rare in nature Unsaturated fats can be altered by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst This action called hydrogenation tends to break all the double bonds and makes a fully saturated fat To make vegetable shortening then liquid cisunsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats which have more desirable physical properties eg they melt at a desirable temperature 30‚Äì40\\xa0¬∞C and store well whereas polyunsaturated oils go rancid when they react with oxygen in the air However trans fats are generated during hydrogenation as contaminants created by an unwanted side reaction on the catalyst during partial hydrogenation Saturated fats can stack themselves in a closely packed arrangement so they can solidify easily and are typically solid at room temperature For example animal fats tallow and lard are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids Olive and linseed oils on the other hand are unsaturated and liquid Fats serve both as energy sources for the body and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about 9 food calories 37 kJ  88 kcal Fats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents glycerol and fatty acids Glycerol itself can be converted to glucose by the liver and so become a source of energy    Chemical structure   There are many different kinds of fats but each is a variation on the same chemical structure All fats are derivatives of fatty acids and glycerol Most fats are glycerides particularly triglycerides triesters of glycerol One chain of fatty acid is bonded to each of the three OH groups of the glycerol by the reaction of the carboxyl end of the fatty acid COOH with the alcohol Ie three chains per molecule Water is eliminated and the carbons are linked by an O bond through dehydration synthesis This process is called esterification and fats are therefore esters As a simple visual illustration if the kinks and angles of these chains were straightened out the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter E The fatty acids would each be a horizontal line the glycerol backbone would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines Fats therefore have ester bonds The properties of any specific fat molecule depend on the particular fatty acids that constitute it Fatty acids form a family of compounds that are composed of increasing numbers of carbon atoms linked into a zigzag chain hydrogen atoms to the side The more carbon atoms there are in any fatty acid the longer its chain will be Long chains are more susceptible to intermolecular forces of attraction in this case van der Waals forces and so the longer ones melt at a higher temperature melting point Fatty acid chains may also differ by length often categorized as short to very long Shortchain fatty acids SCFA are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six carbons ie butyric acid4 Mediumchain fatty acids MCFA are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6‚Äì125 carbons which can form mediumchain triglycerides Longchain fatty acids LCFA are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons6 Very long chain fatty acids VLCFA are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 22 or more carbons Any of these aliphatic fatty acid chains may be glycerated and the resultant fats may have tails of different lengths from very short triformin to very long eg cerotic acid or hexacosanoic acid a 26carbon longchain saturated fatty acid Long chain fats are exemplified by tallow lard whose chains are 17 carbons long Most fats found in food whether vegetable or animal are made up of medium to longchain fatty acids usually of equal or nearly equal length Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy In particular heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids Despite longstanding assertions to the contrary fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells Importance for living organisms Fats are also sources of essential fatty acids an important dietary requirement They provide energy as noted above Vitamins A D E and K are fatsoluble meaning they can only be digested absorbed and transported in conjunction with fats Fats play a vital role in maintaining healthy skin and hair insulating body organs against shock maintaining body temperature and promoting healthy cell function Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases When a particular substance whether chemical or biotic reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream the body can effectively dilute‚Äîor at least maintain equilibrium of‚Äîthe offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue This helps to protect vital organs until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as excretion urination accidental or intentional bloodletting sebum excretion and hair growth Adipose tissue   In animals adipose tissue or fatty tissue is the bodys means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time Adipocytes fat cells store fat derived from the diet and from liver metabolism Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the circulation These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones eg insulin glucagon and epinephrine Adipose tissue also secretes the hormone leptin  The location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile visceral fat is located within the abdominal wall ie beneath the wall of abdominal muscle whereas subcutaneous fat is located beneath the skin and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but above the abdominal muscle wall Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals ie hormones among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses One of these is resistin which has been linked to obesity insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes This latter result is currently controversial and there have been reputable studies supporting all sides on the issue Fatty acids and human health Dietary consumption of fatty acids has effects on human health Studies have found that replacing saturated fats with cis unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular disease For example a 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the Cochrane Library concluded Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats Numerous studies have also found that consumption of trans fats increases risk of cardiovascular disease The Harvard School of Public Health advises that replacing trans fats and saturated fats with cis monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health See

       "  'raw page text': 'In chemistry particularly in biochemistry a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic chain which is either saturated or unsaturated Most naturally occurring fatty acids have an unbranched chain of an even number of carbon atoms from 4 to 28 Fatty acids are usually derived from triglycerides or phospholipids Fatty acids are important dietary sources of fuel for animals because when metabolized they yield large quantities of ATP Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this purpose Longchain fatty acids cannot cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier BBB and so cannot be used as fuel by the cells of the central nervous system however free shortchain fatty acids and mediumchain fatty acids can cross the BBB in addition to glucose and ketone bodies    Types of fatty acids  Fatty acids that have carbon‚Äìcarbon double bonds are known as unsaturated Fatty acids without double bonds are known as saturated They differ in length as well Length of free fatty acid chains Fatty acid chains differ by length often categorized as short to very long Shortchain fatty acids SCFA are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of five or fewer carbons eg butyric acid Mediumchain fatty acids MCFA are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6 to 12 carbons which can form mediumchain triglycerides Longchain fatty acids LCFA are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons Very long chain fatty acids VLCFA are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 22 or more carbons Unsaturated fatty acids  Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds between carbon atoms Pairs of carbon atoms connected by double bonds can be saturated by adding hydrogen atoms to them converting the double bonds to single bonds Therefore the double bonds are called unsaturated The two carbon atoms in the chain that are bound next to either side of the double bond can occur in a cis or trans configuration cis\\xa0 A cis configuration means that the two hydrogen atoms adjacent to the double bond stick out on the same side of the chain The rigidity of the double bond freezes its conformation and in the case of the cis isomer causes the chain to bend and restricts the conformational freedom of the fatty acid The more double bonds the chain has in the cis configuration the less flexibility it has When a chain has many cis bonds it becomes quite curved in its most accessible conformations For example oleic acid with one double bond has a kink in it whereas linoleic acid with two double bonds has a more pronounced bend Œ±Linolenic acid with three double bonds favors a hooked shape The effect of this is that in restricted environments such as when fatty acids are part of a phospholipid in a lipid bilayer or triglycerides in lipid droplets cis bonds limit the ability of fatty acids to be closely packed and therefore can affect the melting temperature of the membrane or of the fat trans\\xa0 A trans configuration by contrast means that the adjacent two hydrogen atoms lie on opposite sides of the chain As a result they do not cause the chain to bend much and their shape is similar to straight saturated fatty acids In most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids each double bond has three n carbon atoms after it for some n and all are cis bonds Most fatty acids in the trans configuration trans fats are not found in nature and are the result of human processing eg hydrogenation The differences in geometry between the various types of unsaturated fatty acids as well as between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids play an important role in biological processes and in the construction of biological structures such as cell membranes Essential fatty acids  Fatty acids that are required by the human body but cannot be made in sufficient quantity from other substrates and therefore must be obtained from food are called essential fatty acids There are two series of essential fatty acids one has a double bond three carbon atoms away from the methyl end the other has a double bond six carbon atoms away from the methyl end Humans lack the ability to introduce double bonds in fatty acids beyond carbons 9 and 10 as counted from the carboxylic acid side Two essential fatty acids are linoleic acid LA and alphalinolenic acid ALA They are widely distributed in plant oils The human body has a limited ability to convert ALA into the longerchain omega3 fatty acids ‚Äî eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA which can also be obtained from fish Omega3 and omega6 fatty acids are biosynthetic precursors to endocannabinoids with antinociceptive anxiolytic and neurogenic properties Saturated fatty acids   Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds Thus saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen since double bonds reduce the number of hydrogens on each carbon Because saturated fatty acids have only single bonds each carbon atom within the chain has 2 hydrogen atoms except for the omega carbon at the end that has 3 hydrogens  Nomenclature Numbering of the carbon atoms in a fatty acid  The position of the carbon atoms in a fatty acid can be indicated from the COOH or carboxy end or from the ‚ÄìCH3 or methyl end If indicated from the COOH end then the C1 C2 C3 ‚Ä¶etc notation is used blue numerals in the diagram on the right where C1 is the ‚ÄìCOOH carbon If the position is counted from the other ‚ÄìCH3 end then the position is indicated by the œân notation numerals in red where œâ1 refers to the methyl carbon The positions of the double bonds in a fatty acid chain can therefore be indicated in two ways using the Cn or the œân notation Thus in an 18 carbon fatty acid a double bond between C12 or œâ7 and C13 or œâ6 is reported either as Œî12 if counted from the ‚ÄìCOOH end indicating only the ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù of the double bond or as œâ6 or omega6 if counting from the ‚ÄìCH3 end The ‚ÄúŒî‚Äù is the Greek letter ‚Äúdelta‚Äù which translates into ‚ÄúD‚Äù  for Double bond in the Roman alphabet Omega œâ is the last letter in the Greek alphabet and is therefore used to indicate the ‚Äúlast‚Äù carbon atom in the fatty acid chain Since the œân notation is used almost exclusively to indicate the positions of the double bonds close to the ‚ÄìCH3 end in essential fatty acids there is no necessity for an equivalent ‚ÄúŒî‚Äùlike notation  the use of the ‚Äúœân‚Äù notation always refers to the position of a double bond Fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms are called oddchain fatty acids whereas the rest are evenchain fatty acids The difference is relevant to gluconeogenesis Naming of fatty acids The following table describes the most common systems of naming fatty acids   Esterified free unsaturated conjugated When fatty acids circulating in the plasma plasma fatty acids are not in their glycerol ester form glycerides they are known as nonesterified fatty acids NEFAs or free fatty acids FFAs The latter term can be viewed as a misnomer because they are transported complexed with a transport protein such as albumin as opposed to being unattached to any other molecule But the term conveys the idea that they are circulating and available for metabolism Fatty acids can exist in various states of saturation Unsaturated fatty acids include monounsaturated fatty acids MUFAs and polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs Conjugated fatty acids are a subset of PUFAs Production Industrial Fatty acids are usually produced industrially by the hydrolysis of triglycerides with the removal of glycerol see oleochemicals Phospholipids represent another source Some fatty acids are produced synthetically by hydrocarboxylation of alkenes By animals  In animals fatty acids are formed from carbohydrates predominantly in the liver adipose tissue and the mammary glands during lactation Carbohydrates are converted into pyruvate by glycolysis as the first important step in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids Pyruvate is then dehydrogenated to form acetylCoA in the mitochondrion However this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids occurs This cannot occur directly To obtain cytosolic acetylCoA citrate produced by the condensation of acetylCoA with oxaloacetate is removed from the citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetylCoA and oxaloacetate The oxaloacetate is returned to the mitochondrion as malate The cytosolic acetylCoA is carboxylated by acetyl CoA carboxylase into malonylCoA the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids MalonylCoA is then involved in a repeating series of reactions that lengthens the growing fatty acid chain by two carbons at a time Almost all natural fatty acids therefore have even numbers of carbon atoms When synthesis is complete the free fatty acids are nearly always combined with glycerol three fatty acids to one glycerol molecule to form triglycerides the main storage form of fatty acids and thus of energy in animals However fatty acids are also important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed the cell wall and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells such as the nucleus the mitochondria endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus The uncombined fatty acids or free fatty acids found in the circulation of animals come from the breakdown or lipolysis of stored triglycerides Because they are insoluble in water these fatty acids are transported bound to plasma albumin The levels of free fatty acids in the blood are limited by the availability of albumin binding sites They can be taken up from the blood by all cells that have mitochondria with the exception of the cells of the central nervous system Fatty acids can only be broken down to CO2 and water in mitochondria by means of betaoxidation followed by further combustion in the citric acid cycle Cells in the central nervous system which although they possess mitochondria cannot take free fatty acids up from the blood as the bloodbrain barrier is impervious to most free fatty acids excluding shortchain fatty acids and mediumchain fatty acids These cells have to manufacture their own fatty acids from carbohydrates as described above in order to produce and maintain the phospholipids of their cell membranes and those of their organelles Fatty acids in dietary fats The following table gives the fatty acid vitamin E and cholesterol composition of some common dietary fats Reactions of fatty acids Fatty acids exhibit reactions like other carboxylic acids ie they undergo esterification and acidbase reactions Acidity Fatty acids do not show a great variation in their acidities as indicated by their respective pKa Nonanoic acid for example has a pKa of 496 being only slightly weaker than acetic acid 476 As the chain length increases the solubility of the fatty acids in water decreases very rapidly so that the longerchain fatty acids have minimal effect on the pH of an aqueous solution Even those fatty acids that are insoluble in water will dissolve in warm ethanol and can be titrated with sodium hydroxide solution using phenolphthalein as an indicator This analysis is used to determine the free fatty acid content of fats ie the proportion of the triglycerides that have been hydrolyzed Hydrogenation and hardening Hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids is widely practiced typical conditions involving 20‚Äì30 MPa of H2 pressure 150 ¬∫C and nickel supported on silica This treatment affords saturated fatty acids as reflected in their iodine number Hydrogenated fatty acids are less prone toward rancidification Since the saturated fatty acids are higher melting than the unsaturated precursors the process is called hardening Related technology is used to convert vegetable oils into margarine The hydrogenation of triglycerides is advantageous because the carboxylic acids degrade the nickel catalysts affording nickel soaps During partial hydrogenation unsaturated fatty acids can be isomerized from cis to trans configuration More forcing hydrogenation ie using higher pressures of H2 and higher temperatures converts fatty acids into fatty alcohols Fatty alcohols are however more easily produced from fatty acid esters In the Varrentrapp reaction certain unsaturated fatty acids are cleaved in molten alkali a reaction at one time of relevance to structure elucidation Autooxidation and rancidity  Unsaturated fatty acids undergo a chemical change known as autooxidation The process requires oxygen air and is accelerated by the presence of trace metals Vegetable oils resist this process because they contain antioxidants such as tocopherol Fats and oils often are treated with chelating agents such as citric acid to remove the metal catalysts Ozonolysis Unsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to degradation by ozone This reaction is practiced in the production of azelaic acid CH27CO2H2 from oleic acid Analysis In chemical analysis fatty acids are separated by gas chromatography of methyl esters additionally a separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by argentation thinlayer chromatography Circulation Digestion and intake  Short and mediumchain fatty acids are absorbed directly into the blood via intestine capillaries and travel through the portal vein just as other absorbed nutrients do However longchain fatty acids are not directly released into the intestinal capillaries Instead they are absorbed into the fatty walls of the intestine villi and reassembled again into triglycerides The triglycerides are coated with cholesterol and protein protein coat into a compound called a chylomicron From within the cell the chylomicron is released into a lymphatic capillary called a lacteal which merges into larger lymphatic vessels It is transported via the lymphatic system and the thoracic duct up to a location near the heart where the arteries and veins are larger The thoracic duct empties the chylomicrons into the bloodstream via the left subclavian vein At this point the chylomicrons can transport the triglycerides to tissues where they are stored or metabolized for energy Metabolism  Fatty acids provided either by ingestion or by drawing on triglycerides stored in fatty tissues are distributed to cells to serve as a fuel for muscular contraction and general metabolism They are broken down to CO2 and water by the intracellular mitochondria releasing large amounts of energy captured in the form of ATP through beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle Distribution  Blood fatty acids are in different forms in different stages in the blood circulation They are taken in through the intestine in chylomicrons but also exist in very low density lipoproteins VLDL and low density lipoproteins LDL after processing in the liver In addition when released from adipocytes fatty acids exist in the blood as free fatty acids It is proposed that the blend of fatty acids exuded by mammalian skin together with lactic acid and pyruvic acid is distinctive and enables animals with a keen sense of smell to differentiate individuals See also Fatty acid synthase Fatty acid synthesis Fatty aldehyde List of saturated

       "  'raw page text': 'Flavonoids or bioflavonoids from the Latin word flavus meaning yellow their color in nature are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites Chemically flavonoids have the general structure of a 15carbon skeleton which consists of two phenyl rings A and B and heterocyclic ring C This carbon structure can be abbreviated C6C3C6 According to the IUPAC nomenclature they can be classified into flavonoids or bioflavonoids isoflavonoids derived from 3phenylchromen4one 3phenyl14benzopyrone structure neoflavonoids derived from 4phenylcoumarine 4phenyl12benzopyrone structure The three flavonoid classes above are all ketonecontaining compounds and as such are anthoxanthins flavones and flavonols This class was the first to be termed bioflavonoids The terms flavonoid and bioflavonoid have also been more loosely used to describe nonketone polyhydroxy polyphenol compounds which are more specifically termed flavanoids The three cycle or heterocycles in the flavonoid backbone are generally called ring A B and C Ring A usually shows a phloroglucinol substitution pattern    Biosynthesis  Functions of flavonoids in plants Flavonoids are widely distributed in plants fulfilling many functions Flavonoids are the most important plant pigments for flower coloration producing yellow or redblue pigmentation in petals designed to attract pollinator animals In higher plants flavonoids are involved in UV filtration symbiotic nitrogen fixation and floral pigmentation They may also act as chemical messengers physiological regulators and cell cycle inhibitors Flavonoids secreted by the root of their host plant help Rhizobia in the infection stage of their symbiotic relationship with legumes like peas beans clover and soy Rhizobia living in soil are able to sense the flavonoids and this triggers the secretion of Nod factors which in turn are recognized by the host plant and can lead to root hair deformation and several cellular responses such as ion fluxes and the formation of a root nodule In addition some flavonoids have inhibitory activity against organisms that cause plant diseases eg Fusarium oxysporum Subgroups Over 5000 naturally occurring flavonoids have been characterized from various plants They have been classified according to their chemical structure and are usually subdivided into the following subgroups for further reading see Anthoxanthins Anthoxanthins are divided into two groups Flavanones Flavanones Flavanonols Flavanonols Flavans  Include flavan3ols flavanols flavan4ols and flavan34diols Flavan3ols flavanols Flavan3ols use the 2phenyl34dihydro2Hchromen3ol skeleton Examples Catechin C Gallocatechin GC Catechin 3gallate Cg Gallocatechin 3gallate GCg Epicatechins Epicatechin EC Epigallocatechin EGC Epicatechin 3gallate ECg Epigallocatechin 3gallate EGCg Theaflavin Examples Theaflavin3gallate Theaflavin3gallate Theaflavin33digallate Thearubigin Proanthocyanidins are dimers trimers oligomers or polymers of the flavanols  Anthocyanidins  Anthocyanidins Anthocyanidins are the aglycones of anthocyanins they use the flavylium 2phenylchromenylium ion skeleton Examples Cyanidin Delphinidin Malvidin Pelargonidin Peonidin Petunidin  Isoflavonoids Isoflavonoids Isoflavones use the 3phenylchromen4one skeleton with no hydroxyl group substitution on carbon at position 2 Examples Genistein Daidzein Glycitein Isoflavanes Isoflavandiols Isoflavenes Coumestans Pterocarpans  Dietary sources    Flavonoids specifically flavanoids such as the catechins are the most common group of polyphenolic compounds in the human diet and are found ubiquitously in plants Flavonols the original bioflavonoids such as quercetin are also found ubiquitously but in lesser quantities The widespread distribution of flavonoids their variety and their relatively low toxicity compared to other active plant compounds for instance alkaloids mean that many animals including humans ingest significant quantities in their diet Foods with a high flavonoid content include parsley onions blueberries and other berries black tea green tea and oolong tea bananas all citrus fruits Ginkgo biloba red wine seabuckthorns buckwheat and dark chocolate with a cocoa content of 70 or greater Further information on dietary sources of flavonoids can be obtained from the US Department of Agriculture flavonoid database Parsley Parsley both fresh and dried contains flavones Blueberries Blueberries are a dietary source of anthocyanidins Black tea Black tea is a rich source of dietary flavan3ols Citrus The citrus flavonoids include hesperidin a glycoside of the flavanone hesperetin quercitrin rutin two glycosides of the flavonol quercetin and the flavone tangeritin Wine  Cocoa  Flavonoids exist naturally in cocoa but because they can be bitter they are often removed from chocolate even dark chocolate Although flavonoids are present in milk chocolate milk may interfere with their absorption however this conclusion has been questioned Peanut Peanut red skin contains significant polyphenol content including flavonoids  Dietary intake  Food composition data for flavonoids were provided by the USDA database on flavonoids In the United States NHANES survey mean flavonoid intake was 190\\xa0mgd in adults with flavan3ols as the main contributor In the European Union based on data from EFSA mean flavonoid intake was 140\\xa0mgd although there were considerable differences between individual countries  The main type of flavonoids consumed in the EU and USA were flavan3ols mainly from tea while intake of other flavonoids was considerably lower Research Though there is ongoing research into the potential health benefits of individual flavonoids neither the Food and Drug Administration FDA nor the European Food Safety Authority EFSA has approved any health claim for flavonoids or approved any flavonoids as pharmaceutical drugs Moreover several companies have been cautioned by the FDA over misleading health claims In vitro Flavonoids have been shown to have a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities in in vitro studies Examples include antiallergic antiinflammatory antioxidant antimicrobial antibacterial antifungal and antiviral anticancer and antidiarrheal activities Flavonoids have also been shown to inhibit topoisomerase enzymes and to induce DNA mutations in the mixedlineage leukemia MLL gene in in vitro studies However in most of the above cases no follow up in vivo or clinical research has been performed leaving it impossible to say if these activities have any beneficial or detrimental effect on human health Biological and pharmacological activities which have been investigated in greater depth are described below Antioxidant Research at the Linus Pauling Institute and the European Food Safety Authority shows that flavonoids are poorly absorbed in the human body less than 5 with most of what is absorbed being quickly metabolized and excreted These findings suggest that flavonoids have negligible systemic antioxidant activity and that the increase in antioxidant capacity of blood seen after consumption of flavonoidrich foods is not caused directly by flavonoids but is due to production of uric acid resulting from flavonoid depolymerization and excretion Inflammation Inflammation has been implicated as a possible origin of numerous local and systemic diseases such as cancer cardiovascular disorders diabetes mellitus and celiac disease Preliminary studies indicate that flavonoids may affect antiinflammatory mechanisms via their ability to inhibit reactive oxygen or nitrogen compounds Flavonoids have also been proposed to inhibit the proinflammatory activity of enzymes involved in free radical production such as cyclooxygenase lipoxygenase or inducible nitric oxide synthase and to modify intracellular signaling pathways in immune cells or in brain cells after a stroke Procyanidins a class of flavonoids have been shown in preliminary research to have antiinflammatory mechanisms including modulation of the arachidonic acid pathway inhibition of gene transcription expression and activity of inflammatory enzymes as well as secretion of antiinflammatory mediators Cancer Clinical studies investigating the relationship between flavonoid consumption and cancer preventiondevelopment are conflicting for most types of cancer probably because most studies are retrospective in design and use a small sample size Two apparent exceptions are gastric carcinoma and smokingrelated cancers Dietary flavonoid intake is associated with reduced gastric carcinoma risk in women and reduced aerodigestive tract cancer risk in smokers Cardiovascular diseases Among the most intensively studied of general human disorders possibly affected by dietary flavonoids preliminary cardiovascular disease research has revealed the following mechanisms under investigation in patients or normal subjects inhibit coagulation thrombus formation or platelet aggregation reduce risk of atherosclerosis reduce arterial blood pressure and risk of hypertension reduce oxidative stress and related signaling pathways in blood vessel cells modify vascular inflammatory mechanisms improve endothelial and capillary function modify blood lipid levels regulate carbohydrate and glucose metabolism modify mechanisms of aging Listed on the clinical trial registry of the US National Institutes of Health July 2016 are 48 human studies completed or underway to study the dietary effects of plant flavonoids on cardiovascular diseases However populationbased studies have failed to show a strong beneficial effect which might be due to the considerably lower intake in the habitual diet of those investigated Antibacterial Flavonoids have been shown to have a direct antibacterial activity b synergistic activity with antibiotics and c the ability to suppress bacterial virulence factors in numerous in vitro and a limited number of in vivo studies Noteworthy among the in vivo studies is the finding that oral quercetin protects guinea pigs against the Group 1 carcinogen Helicobacter pylori Researchers from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition have speculated this may be one reason why dietary flavonoid intake is associated with reduced gastric carcinoma risk in European women Additional in vivo and clinical research is needed to determine if flavonoids could be used as pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of bacterial infection or whether dietary flavonoid intake offers any protection against infection Synthesis detection quantification and semisynthetic alterations Color spectrum Flavonoid synthesis in plants is induced by light color spectrums at both high and low energy radiations Low energy radiations are accepted by phytochrome while high energy radiations are accepted by carotenoids flavins cryptochromes in addition to phytochromes The photomorphogenic process of phytochomemediated flavonoid biosynthesis has been observed in Amaranthus barley maize Sorghum and turnip Red light promotes flavonoid synthesis Availability through microorganisms Several recent research articles have demonstrated the efficient production of flavonoid molecules from genetically engineered microorganisms Tests for detection Shinoda test Four pieces of magnesium filings are added to the ethanolic extract followed by few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid A pink or red colour indicates the presence of flavonoid Colours varying from orange to red indicated flavones red to crimson indicated flavonoids crimson to magenta indicated flavonones Sodium hydroxide test About 5\\xa0mg of the compound is dissolved in water warmed and filtered 10 aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to 2 ml of this solution This produces a yellow coloration A change in color from yellow to colorless on addition of dilute hydrochloric acid is an indication for the presence of flavonoids pDimethylaminocinnamaldehyde test A colorimetric assay based upon the reaction of Arings with the chromogen pdimethylaminocinnamaldehyde DMACA has been developed for flavanoids in beer that can be compared with the vanillin procedure Quantification Lamaison and Carnet have designed a test for the determination of the total flavonoid content of a sample AlCI3 method After proper mixing of the sample and the reagent the mixture is incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature and the absorbance of the solution is read at 440\\xa0nm Flavonoid content is expressed in mgg of quercetin

       "  'raw page text': 'Fluid balance is an aspect of the homeostasis of organisms in which the amount of water in the organism needs to be controlled via osmoregulation and behavior such that the concentrations of electrolytes salts in solution in the various body fluids are kept within healthy ranges The core principle of fluid balance is that the amount of water lost from the body must equal the amount of water taken in for example in humans the output via respiration perspiration urination defecation and expectoration must equal the input via eating and drinking or by parenteral intake Euvolemia is the state of normal body fluid volume including blood volume interstitial fluid volume and intracellular fluid volume hypovolemia and hypervolemia are imbalances Water is necessary for all life on Earth Humans can survive for 4 to 6 weeks without food but only for a few days without water Profuse sweating can increase the need for electrolyte replacement Waterelectrolyte imbalance produces headache and fatigue if mild illness if moderate and sometimes even death if severe For example water intoxication which results in hyponatremia the process of consuming too much water too quickly can be fatal Deficits to body water result in volume contraction and dehydration Diarrhea is a threat to both body water volume and electrolyte levels which is why diseases that cause diarrhea are great threats to fluid balance    Applications Water consumption The amount of water varies with the individual as it depends on the condition of the subject the amount of physical exercise and on the environmental temperature and humidity In the US the reference daily intake RDI for water is 37 litres per day lday for human males older than 18 and 27 lday for human females older than 18 including water contained in food beverages and drinking water The common misconception that everyone should drink two litres 68 ounces or about eight 8oz glasses of water per day is not supported by scientific research Various reviews of all the scientific literature on the topic performed in 2002 and 2008 could not find any solid scientific evidence that recommended drinking eight glasses of water per day For example people in hotter climates will require greater water intake than those in cooler climates An individuals thirst provides a better guide for how much water they require rather than a specific fixed number A more flexible guideline is that a normal person should urinate 4 times per day and the urine should be a light yellow color A constant supply is needed to replenish the fluids lost through normal physiological activities such as respiration perspiration and urination Food contributes 05 to 1 lday and the metabolism of protein fat and carbohydrates produces another 025 to 04 lday which means that 2 to 3 lday of water for men and 1 to 2 lday of water for women should be consumed as fluid to meet the Recommended Daily Intake RDI Trace elements In terms of mineral nutrients intake it is unclear what the drinking water contribution is However inorganic minerals generally enter surface water and ground water via storm water runoff or through the Earths crust Treatment processes also lead to the presence of some minerals Examples include calcium zinc manganese phosphate fluoride and sodium compounds Water generated from the biochemical metabolism of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some arthropods and desert animals but provides only a small fraction of a humans necessary intake There are a variety of trace elements present in virtually all potable water some of which play a role in metabolism For example sodium potassium and chloride are common chemicals found in small amounts in most waters and these elements play a role in body metabolism Other elements such as fluoride while arguably beneficial in low concentrations can cause dental problems and other issues when present at high levels Water is essential for the growth and maintenance of our bodies as it is involved in a number of biological processes Medical use Effects of illness When a person is ill fluid may also be lost through vomiting diarrhea and hemorrhage An individual is at an increased risk of dehydration in these instances as the kidneys will find it more difficult to match fluid loss by reducing urine output the kidneys must produce at least some urine in order to excrete metabolic waste Oral rehydration therapy  Oral rehydration therapy ORT is type of fluid replacement used as a treatment for dehydration In an acute hospital setting fluid balance is monitored carefully This provides information on the patients state of hydration renal function and cardiovascular function If fluid loss is greater than fluid gain for example if the patient vomits and has diarrhea the patient is said to be in negative fluid balance In this case fluid is often given intravenously to compensate for the loss On the other hand a positive fluid balance where fluid gain is greater than fluid loss might suggest a problem with either the renal or cardiovascular system If blood pressure is low hypotension the filtration rate in the kidneys will lessen causing less fluid reabsorption and thus less urine output An accurate measure of fluid balance is therefore an important diagnostic tool and allows for prompt intervention to correct the imbalance Routes of fluid loss and gain Fluid can leave the body in many ways Fluid can enter the body as preformed water ingested food and drink and to a lesser extent as metabolic water which is produced as a byproduct of aerobic respiration cellular respiration and dehydration synthesis Input A constant supply is needed to replenish the fluids lost through normal physiological activities such as respiration sweating and urination Water generated from the biochemical metabolism of nutrients provides a significant proportion of the daily water requirements for some arthropods and desert animals but provides only a small fraction of a humans necessary intake In the normal resting state input of water through ingested fluids is approximately 1200 mlday from ingested foods 1000 mlday and from aerobic respiration 300 mlday totaling 2500 mlday Regulation of input  Input of water is regulated mainly through ingested fluids which in turn depends on thirst An insufficiency of water results in an increased osmolarity in the extracellular fluid This is sensed by osmoreceptors in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis which trigger thirst Thirst can to some degree be voluntarily resisted as during fluid restriction The human kidneys will normally adjust to varying levels of water intake The kidneys will require time to adjust to the new water intake level This can cause someone who drinks a lot of water to become dehydrated more easily than someone who routinely drinks less Output The majority of fluid output occurs via the urine approximately 1500 mlday approx 159 qtday in the normal adult resting state Some fluid is lost through perspiration part of the bodys temperature control mechanism and as water vapor in exhaled air These are termed insensible fluid losses as they cannot be easily measured Some sources say insensible losses account for 500 to 650 mlday 05 to 06 qt of water in adults while other sources put the minimum value at 800 ml 08 qt In children one calculation used for insensible fluid loss is 400\\xa0mlm2 body surface area In addition an adult loses approximately 100\\xa0mlday of fluid through feces For females an additional 50 mlday is lost through vaginal secretions These outputs are in balance with the input of 2500 mlday Regulation of output The bodys homeostatic control mechanisms which maintain a constant internal environment ensure that a balance between fluid gain and fluid loss is maintained The antidiuretic hormones vasopressin ADH and aldosterone play a major role in this If the body is becoming fluiddeficient there will be an increase in the secretion of these hormones causing fluid to be retained by the kidneys and urine output to be reduced Conversely if fluid levels are excessive secretion of these hormones is suppressed resulting in less retention of fluid by the kidneys and a subsequent increase in the volume of urine produced Antidiuretic hormone  If the body is becoming fluiddeficient this will be sensed by osmoreceptors in the vascular organ of lamina terminalis and subfornical organ These areas project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus which contain neurons that secrete the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin from their nerve endings in the posterior pituitary Thus there will be an increase in the secretion of antidiuretic hormone causing fluid to be retained by the kidneys and urine output to be reduced Aldosterone  A fluidinsufficiency causes a decreased perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys This activates the reninangiotensin system Among other actions it causes renal tubules ie the distal convoluted tubules and the cortical collecting ducts to reabsorb more sodium and water from the urine Potassium is secreted into the tubule in exchange for the sodium which is reabsorbed The activated reninangiotensin system stimulates the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex which in turn secretes the hormone aldosterone This hormone stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions from distal tubules and collecting ducts Water in the tubular lumen cannot follow the sodium reabsorption osmotically as this part of the kidney is impermeable to water release of ADH vasopressin is required to increase expression of aquaporin channels in the cortical collecting duct allowing reabsorption of water See also Drinking water References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Modern understanding of disease is very different from the way it was understood in ancient Greece and Rome The way modern physicians approach healing of the sick differs greatly from the methods used by early general healers or elite physicians like Hippocrates or Galen In modern medicine the understanding of disease stems from the ‚Äúgerm theory of disease‚Äù a concept that emerged in the second half of the 19th century such that a disease is the result of an invasion of a microorganism into a living host Therefore when a person becomes ill modern treatments ‚Äútarget‚Äù the specific pathogen or bacterium in order to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù or ‚Äúkill‚Äù the disease In Ancient Greece and Rome disease was literally understood as disease or physical imbalance Medical intervention therefore was purposed with goal of restoration of harmony rather than waging a war against disease Surgery was regarded by Greek and Roman physicians as extreme and damaging while prevention was seen as the crucial first step to healing almost all ailments In both prevention and treatment of disease in classical medicine food and diet was central The eating of correctlybalanced foods made up the majority of preventative treatment as well as to restore harmony to the body after it encountered disease    Food and Diet in Ancient Greece Humours and Causes of Disease Ancient Greek Medicine is described as rational ethical and based upon observation conscious learning and experience Superstition and religious dogmatism are often excluded from descriptions of ancient Greek medicine It is important however to note that this rational approach to medicine did not always exist in the ancient Greek medical world nor was it the only popular method of healing Along with rational Greek medicine disease was also thought of as being of supernatural origin resulting from the unhappiness of the gods or from demonic possession Exorcists and religious healers were among the ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô that patients sought out when they became ill Sacrifices exorcisms spells and prayers were then carried out in order to reconcile with the gods and restore health to the patient It was not until the time of Hippocrates between 450 and 350 BC that rational observation and the humoral theory of medicine began to become highly influential The theory of the humours or ‚ÄúHumorism‚Äù understood the human body to be composed of fluid humours and regarded disease as a result of an imbalance of the four humors yellow bile black bile phlegm and blood  These humours contain qualities such as hot cool moist dry etc which must also remain in balance Foods can be heating cooling or generative of one humour Some foods produce good juices and others bad juices and often times cooking and preparation of the foods can change or improve the juices of the foods In addition foods may be easy to assimilate easy to pass through the body easily excreted nourishing or not nourishing In Hippocratic medicine the qualities in foods are analogous to the four humors in the body too much of a single one is bad a proper mixture is ideal Therefore the consumption of correctlybalanced foods and lifestyle of the patient was crucial to the prevention and treatment of disease in Ancient Greece This brings us to the way in which seasonal food played an important role in the treatment of ancient disease According to the Hippocratic author of ‚ÄúAirs Waters and Places‚Äù there remains debate as to whether Hippocrates himself wrote the Hippocratic Corpus it is important that a physician learn astronomy because ‚Äúthe changes of the seasons produce changes in diseases‚Äù In the same Hippocratic text the author goes on to explain that villages facing east and that are exposed to winds from the northeast southeast and west tended to be healthy and ‚ÄúThe climate in such a district may be compared with the spring in that there are no extremes of heat and cold As a consequence diseases in such a district are few and not severe‚Äù As an example of the importance of seasonal food on maintaining balance of the humours and preventing disease is given by Hippocrates in ‚ÄúOn Regimen‚Äù when the authors state that ‚Äúin winter to secure a dry and hot body it is better to eat wheaten bread roast meat and few vegetables whereas in summer it is appropriate to eat barley cake barley meat and softer foods‚Äù qtd in Wilkins et al p\\xa0346 Food and Diet in the Hippocratic Aphorisms Food and diet feature prominently in the aphorisms of the Hippocratic Corpus For example in one aphorism in the first section Hippocrates states ‚ÄúThings which are growing have the greatest natural warmth and accordingly need most nourishment Failing this the body becomes exhausted Old men have little warmth and they need little food which produces warmth too much only extinguishes the warmth they have For this reason fevers are not so acute in old people for then the body is cold‚Äù Another aphorism says ‚ÄúIt is better to be full of drink than full of food‚Äù And finally an aphorism that generally sums up treatment of disease in Hippocratic times states ‚ÄúDisease which results from overeating is cured by fasting disease following fasting by a surfeit So with other things cures may be effected by opposites‚Äù This concept of treating diseases opposite to the way it manifests in the individual is concept that is carried over into Roman medicine Gout in Ancient Greece Gout was called podagra in ancient Greek medicine and is a common arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals within the joints Gout usually affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe and later the other joints of the feet and hands Hippocrates considered gout to be the result of an accumulation of one of the body humours that distended the joint and caused pain Hippocrates also believed gout to be a result from sexual excess or too rich a diet as alluded to in three of his aphorisms ‚ÄúEunuchs do not take the gout nor become bald‚Äù ‚ÄúA woman does not take the gout unless her menses has stopped‚Äù and ‚ÄúA young man does not take the gout until he indulges coitus‚Äù As with other diseases physicians in antiquity believed that diet was the best way to manage gout Hippocrates recommended high doses of white hellebore because he believed that the best and most natural relief for gout was dysentery However purging with white hellebore was probably for the more chronic cases due to the fact that wine and barleywater drinks were very strongly recommended Legumes in Ancient Greece The importance of legumes in ancient Greek diet and medical practice is often disregarded However legumes improved the quality of the soil and were considered very important to the agriculturalists of the time Additionally legumes contain a high amount of albumen which led them to be a critical dietary supplement in countries where meat was in short supply and difficult to store Such was the case with Greece People in the GraecoRoman world consumed less meat than we do today and therefore legumes were a necessary source of protein Of all legumes the lentil  appears most frequently in Greek and Roman literature Medicinally Hippocrates recommends lentils as a remedy for ulcers and hemorrhoids Bitter vetch or Vicia ervilia was also an important legume in ancient Greek medicine The extensive medicinal qualities of the bitter vetch were thought reliable enough to later administer to Roman emperors such as Augustus Bitter vetch was thought to heal pimples prevent sores from spreading and soothe spots or sores when they appear on the breasts It was also reported to relieve painful urination flatulence liver problems and indigestion when roasted and mixed with honey and Hippocrates cautioned that when eaten boiled or raw the consumption of bitter vetch may cause more flatulence or pain Food and Diet in Ancient Rome Humours Anatomy and the Causes of Disease At the heart of Roman Medicine and central to the development of Western Medicine is Galen  of Pergamum AD 129‚Äìc AD 210 Galen was a prolific writer from whose surviving works comes what Galen believed to be the definitive guide to a healthy diet based on the theory of the four humours Galen understood the humoral theory in a dynamic sense rather than static sense such that yellow bile is hot and dry like fire black bile is dry and cold like earth phlegm is cold and moist like water and blood is moist and hot He also understood the humours to be produced by food through digestion and it is with digestion and respiration that Galen applies his knowledge of anatomy According to Galen digestion begins in the mouth because this where food comes into contact with the saliva The chewed food is then pulled into the stomach where the heat of the stomach cooks the food into chyle The chyle is then carried to the liver where the nutrients are converted to blood and transported throughout the body With this understanding of the humours as being dynamic and his knowledge of anatomy Galen was able to categorize illnesses as hot cold dry or moist and attribute the causes of these illnesses to specific types of foods For example in Galen‚Äôs own ‚ÄúOn the Causes of Disease‚Äù as cited by Mark Grant Galen says when describing hot diseases that ‚Äúone cause of excessive heat lies in foods that have hot and harsh powers such as garlic leeks onions and so on Immoderate use of these foods sometimes sparks a fever‚Äù Galen believed that a good physician must also be a good cook Therefore in Galen‚Äôs dietary treatise ‚ÄúOn the Powers of Foods‚Äù recipes are often given in addition to descriptions of foods as being salty or sweet sour or watery difficult or easy to digest costive or laxative cooling or heating etc Galen insists that the balance of the four humours can be beneficially or adversely effected by ‚Äòdiet‚Äô which in Galenic medicine includes not just food and drink but also physical exercise baths massage and climate Food and the Treatment of Disease in Ancient Rome As mentioned certain types of food can affect the balance of the humours in different ways According to Galen‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn Humours‚Äù as referenced by Wilkins et al beef camel and goat meat snails cabbage and soft cheeses produce black bile brains fungi and hard apples cause phlegm bitter almonds and garlic reduce phlegm Additionally for the treatment of gout Galen suggested a range of dressings to be applied to the affected area made of mandrake caper and henbane and for the acute phase creams made of seeds of conium mushroom and deer brain were administered References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Food composition data FCD are detailed sets of information on the nutritionally important components of foods and provide values for energy and nutrients including protein carbohydrates fat vitamins and minerals and for other important food components such as fibre The data are presented in food composition databases FCDBs In the UK FCD is listed in tables known as The Chemical Composition of Foods McCance and Widdowson 1940 and in the first edition the authors stated that ‚ÄòA knowledge of the chemical composition of foods is the first essential in the dietary treatment of disease or in any quantitative study of human nutrition‚Äô This demonstrates the main reason for establishing FCD at that time To this day food composition studies remain central to nutrition research into the role of food components and their interactions in health and disease However due to increasing levels of sophistication and complexity in nutrition science there is a greater demand for complete current and reliable FCD together with information on a wider range of food components including bioactive compounds FCD are important in many fields including clinical practice research nutrition policy public health and education and the food manufacturing industry and is used in a variety of ways including national programmes for the assessment of diet and nutritional status at a population level eg epidemiological researchers assessing diets at a population level development of therapeutic diets eg to treat obesity diabetes nutritional deficiencies food allergy and intolerance and institutional diets eg schools hospitals prisons daycare centres and nutrition labelling of processed foods The earliest food composition tables were based solely on chemical analyses of food samples which were mostly undertaken specifically for the tables However as the food supply has evolved and with the increasing demand for nutritional and related components it has become more difficult for compilers to rely only on chemical analysis when compiling FCDBs For example in the UK the third edition of The Composition of Foods presented data on vitamin content of foods However due to the amount of information already available and in order to avoid the need to analyse every food for every vitamin values from the scientific literature were included although the tables are still predominately based on analytical data Nowadays food composition databases tend to be compiled using a variety of methods including    Chemical analysis Chemical analysis of food samples carried out in analytical laboratories is typically the preferred method for creating FCD The food samples are carefully chosen using a defined sampling plan to ensure that they are representative of the foods being consumed in a country This includes accounting for factors that could affect the nutrient content of a food as purchased eg region andor country of origin season brand fortification or as consumed eg storage preparation and cooking methods If necessary further preparation and cooking takes place prior to the analysis using appropriate analytical methods and often appropriate samples of foods are combined rather than taking averages of individually analysed food samples Ideally the methods used for analysis should have been shown to be reliable and reproducible ie those recommended by organisation such as the Association of Official Analytical Chemists AOAC or the International Organisation for Standardisation ISO Imputing and calculating values from data already within the database It is not feasible to determine FCD using chemical analysis for every nutrient in every food type due to insufficient resources Therefore compilers of FCDB use other approaches to determine the required FCD within a FCDB For example to estimate values for a cooked food values for a raw food or dish can often be used together with information on likely weight or yield gainloss and nutrient changes eg vitamin losses due to cooking Estimating FCD values from other sources Another approach commonly used by FCD compilers is to ‚Äòborrow‚Äô or ‚Äòadopt‚Äô nutrient values that were originally generated by another organisation Possible sources for borrowed data are FCD from other countries nutrient analyses from scientific literature or manufacturers‚Äô data eg from food labels Compilers will need to evaluate the data in terms of both data quality and applicability of foods before incorporating it from any of these sources into their FCDBs For example fortification values can differ between countries so a fortified breakfast cereal for one country‚Äôs FCD might not be appropriate for another country Data evaluation and quality An important step for both new analytical FCD and for values borrowed from other sources is for the compiler to evaluate the quality of the data before it can be added into FCDBs Basic evaluation where feasible should be considered such as comparing the values to similar foods from other sources and checking whether the sums of the values equate to 100 eg sum of water protein fat carbohydrate and dietary fibre In addition a range of data quality measures need to be undertaken relating to the food identity and sampling and analytical aspects For example the USA has developed a multinutrient data quality evaluation system for which five evaluation categories are used including sampling plan number of samples sample handling analytical method and analytical quality control Ratings for each category are combined to give a ‚ÄòQuality Index‚Äô and a confidence code indicating to users the level of confidence for each value In Europe EuroFIR is currently developing a data quality evaluation system for European data based on the USA‚Äôs version Food composition dataset Food composition datasets FCDBs or food composition tables are resources that provide detailed food composition data FCD on the nutritionally important components of foods FCDBs provide values for energy and nutrients including protein carbohydrates fat vitamins and minerals and for other important food components such as fibre Before computer technology these resources existed in printed tables with the oldest tables dating back to the early 19th century In the UK FCD are listed in tables known as The Chemical Composition of Foods McCance and Widdowson 1940 FCDBs have become available online on the internet for example the USDA Dataset in the States the Japanese food composition dataset and a number of European food composition datasets Foods from these national FCDBs can be identified by International Food Code IFC FCDBs differ in both the data that is available and in the amount of data that is held For example some FCDBs have values for individual amino acids andor vitamin fractions eg individual carotenoids such as lycopene and lutein Some specialised datasets are also available eg bioactive compounds are included in the EuroFIR eBASIS dataset in the US isoflavone dataset and in the French PhenolExplorer dataset In addition the 2009 version of the Swiss FCDB contains 935 foods while the recent version of the USDA FCDB includes over 7500 foods Some datasets include a wider range of processed foods composite dishes and recipes as well as foods prepared and cooked in different ways For example in the UK FCDB bacon rashers are included as raw dryfried grilled grilled crispy or microwaved The data are estimations Variability in the composition of foods between countries owing to for example season cultivar or variety brand fortification levels Incomplete coverage of foods or nutrients leading to missing values Age of data limited resources mean that inevitably some values are not current Collection process FCDBs are usually created using a variety of methods including see Food composition data Chemical analysis of food samples carried out in analytical laboratories Imputing and calculating values from data already within the dataset Estimating values from other sources including manufacturers food labels scientific literature and FCDBs from other countries History Some of the earliest work related to detecting adulterated foods and finding the active components of medicinal herbs Food composition tables in the format known today were published towards the end of the 19th century although some tables on the chemical composition of mineral waters were assembled by Morveau as early as 1780 In 1896 tables from the USA were published incorporating nearly 2600 analyses of a wide range of foods including the main food groups as well as some processed foods Values for foods were presented as ‚Äòrefuse‚Äô water protein fats carbohydrates ash and ‚Äòfuel value‚Äô The first UK tables known as McCance and Widdowson‚Äôs The Composition of Foods were published in 1940 The Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO published tables for international use and initially intended these for the assessment of food availability at the global level A list of International FCDBs can be found on the National Food Institute  Technical University of Denmarks DTU website Documentation The documentation of FCD is an important process of compiling FCDBs because it enables the user to assess the quality of the data and whether the food and values are appropriate for the user‚Äôs intended purpose Moreover documentation is valuable to the compilers both to update the FCDB and to validate decisions made during compilation With systems generally now being computerised it is much easier to make documentation available For example the French national database provides information where possible on minimum and maximum values found from the different data sources used the number of samples used to determine the selected value a reference code corresponding to data sources for a given value and a confidence code characterising the quality of the given value EuroFIR has developed a framework for the documentation of FCD which forms the basis of a new European standard for the interchange and harmonisation of FCD across Europe References  Further

carcinogens found in foods Greenpeace exposed in 2006 in China that 25 of surveyed supermarkets agricultural products contained banned pesticides Over 70 of tomatoes that tested were found to have the banned pesticide Lindane and almost 40 of the samples had a mix of three or more types of pesticides Fruits were also tested in this investigation Tangerines strawberries and Kyofung grapes samples were found contaminated by banned pesticides including the highly toxic Methamidophos These fruits can also be found in Hong Kong market Greenpeace says there exists no comprehensive monitoring on

as a preservative to noodles tofu salted fish and meatballs 2008 Chinese milk scandal Hair in food There is a heavy stigma attached to the presence of hair in food in most societies There is a risk that it may induce choking and vomiting and also that it may be contaminated by toxic substances Views differ as to the level of risk it poses to the inadvertent consumer In most countries people working in the food industry are required to cover their hair because it will contaminate the food When people are served food which contains hair in restaurants or caf√©s it is usual for them to complain to the staff Despite this it is not a valid ground on which to sue the restaurant in the United States but in the United Kingdom it breaks the regulations of the UK Food Safety Act 1990 and people can sue over this There are a range of possible reasons for the objection to hair in food ranging from cultural taboos to the simple fact that it is difficult to digest and unpleasant to eat It may also be interpreted as a sign of more widespread problems with hygiene The introduction of completecapture hairnets is believed to have resulted in a decrease in incidents of contamination of this type Sometimes protein from human hair is used as a food ingredient in bread and other such similar products Such use of human hair in food is forbidden in Islam Historically in Judaism finding hair in food was a sign of bad luck Processing contaminants Processing contaminants are generated during the processing of foods eg\\xa0heating fermentation They are absent in the raw materials and are formed by chemical reactions between natural andor added food constituents during processing The presence of these contaminants in processed foods cannot be entirely avoided Technological processes can be adjusted andor optimized however in order to reduce the levels of formation of processing contaminants Examples are nitrosamines polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAH heterocyclic amines histamine acrylamide furan benzene trans fat 3MCPD semicarbazide 4hydroxynonenal 4HNE and ethyl carbamate There is also the possibility of metal chips from the processing equipment contaminating food These can be identified using metal detection equipment In many conveyor lines the line will be stopped or when weighing the product with a Check weigher the item can be rejected for being over or underweight or because small pieces of metal are detected within it Emerging food contaminants While many food contaminants have been known for decades the formation and presence of certain chemicals in foods has been discovered relatively recently These are the socalled emerging food contaminants like acrylamide furan benzene perchlorate perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA 3monochloropropane13diol 3MCPD 4hydroxynonenal and 4HNE Safety and regulation Acceptable Daily Intake ADI levels and tolerable concentrations of contaminants in individual foods are determined on the basis of the No Observed Adverse Effect Level NOAEL in animal experiments by using a safety factor usually 100 The maximum concentrations of contaminants allowed by legislation are often well below toxicological tolerance levels because such levels can often be reasonably achieved by using good agricultural and manufacturing practices Regulatory officials in order to combat the dangers associated with foodborne viruses are pursuing various possible measures The EFSA published a report in 2011 on ‚Äúscientific opinion regarding an update of the present knowledge on the occurrence and control of foodborne viruses‚Äù This year an expert working group created by the European Committee for Standardization CEN is expected to publish a standard method for the detection of norovirus and hepatitis\\xa0A virus in food The CODEX Committee on Food Hygiene CCFH is also working on a guideline which is now ready for final adoption European Commission Regulation EC No 20732005 of 15 November 2005 indicates that ‚Äúfoodstuffs should not contain microorganisms or their toxins or metabolites in quantities that present an unacceptable risk for human health‚Äù underlining that methods are required for foodborne virus detection Food contaminant testing To maintain high quality of food and comply with health safety and environmental regulatory standards it is best to rely on food contaminant testing through an independent third party such as laboratories certification companies or similar For manufacturers the testing for food contaminants can minimize the risk of noncompliance in relation to raw ingredients semimanufactured foods and final products Also food contaminant testing assures consumers safety and quality of purchased food products and can prevent foodborne diseases and chemical microbiological or physical food hazards The establishment of ADIs for certain emerging food contaminants is currently an active area of research and regulatory debate See also Bad Bug Book from the

       "  'raw page text': 'Food energy is chemical energy that animals including humans derive from food through the process of cellular respiration Cellular respiration may either involve the chemical reaction of food molecules with molecular oxygen aerobic respiration or the process of reorganizing the food molecules without additional oxygen anaerobic respiration Humans and other animals need a minimum intake of food energy to sustain their metabolism and to drive their muscles Foods are composed chiefly of carbohydrates fats proteins water vitamins and minerals Carbohydrates fats proteins and water represent virtually all the weight of food with vitamins and minerals making up only a small percentage of the weight Carbohydrates fats and proteins comprise ninety percent of the dry weight of foods Organisms derive food energy from carbohydrates fats and proteins as well as from organic acids polyols and ethanol present in the diet Some diet components that provide little or no food energy such as water minerals vitamins cholesterol and fiber may still be necessary to health and survival for other reasons Water minerals vitamins and cholesterol are not broken down they are used by the body in the form in which they are absorbed and so cannot be used for energy Fiber cannot be completely digested by most animals including humans However ruminants can extract food energy from the respiration of cellulose because of bacteria in their rumens Using the International System of Units researchers measure energy in joules J or in its multiples the kilojoule kJ is most often used for foodrelated quantities An older metric system unit of energy still widely used in foodrelated contexts is the calorie more precisely the food calorie large calorie or kilocalorie kcal or Cal equal to 4184 kilojoules Contrast the small calorie cal equal to 11000 of a food calorie that is often used in chemistry and in physics Within the European Union both the kilocalorie kcal and kilojoule kJ appear on nutrition labels In many countries only one of the units is displayed in Canada and the United States labels spell out the unit as calorie or as Calorie Fats and ethanol have the greatest amount of food energy per gram 37 and 29\\xa0kJg 88 and 69\\xa0kcalg respectively Proteins and most carbohydrates have about 17\\xa0kJg 4\\xa0kcalg The differing energy density of foods fat alcohols carbohydrates and proteins lies mainly in their varying proportions of carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms For food of elemental composition CcHhOoNn the heat of combustion underlying the food energy is 100\\xa0kcalg c  03 h ‚àí 05 o12 c  h  16 o  14 n to a good approximation ¬±3 Carbohydrates that are not easily absorbed such as fiber or lactose in lactoseintolerant individuals contribute less food energy Polyols including sugar alcohols and organic acids contribute 10\\xa0kJg 24\\xa0kcalg and 13\\xa0kJg 31\\xa0kcalg respectively The amount of water fat and fiber in foods determines those foods energy density Theoretically one could measure food energy in different ways using say the Gibbs free energy of combustion or the amount of ATP generated by metabolizing the food However the convention is to use the heat of the oxidation reaction producing liquid water Conventional food energy is based on heats of combustion in a bomb calorimeter and corrections that take into consideration the efficiency of digestion and absorption and the production of urea and other substances in the urine The American chemist Wilbur Atwater worked these corrections out in the late 19th century see Atwater system for more detail Based on the work of Atwater it became common practice to calculate energy content of foods using 4\\xa0kcalg for carbohydrates and proteins and 9\\xa0kcalg for lipids The system was later improved by Annabel Merrill and Bernice Watt of the United States Department of Agriculture who derived a system whereby specific calorie conversion factors for different foods were proposed    Nutrition labels  Many governments require food manufacturers to label the energy content of their products to help consumers control their energy intake In the European Union manufacturers of packaged food must label the nutritional energy of their products in both kilocalories and kilojoules when required In the United States the equivalent mandatory labels display only Calories often as a substitute for the name of the quantity being measured food energy an additional kilojoules figure is optional and is rarely used In Australia and New Zealand the food energy must be stated in kilojoules and optionally in kilocalories as well and other nutritional energy information is similarly conveyed in kilojoules The energy available from the respiration of food is usually given on labels for 100\\xa0g for a typical serving size according to the manufacturer andor for the entire pack contents The amount of food energy associated with a particular food could be measured by completely burning the dried food in a bomb calorimeter a method known as direct calorimetry However the values given on food labels are not determined in this way The reason for this is that direct calorimetry also burns the dietary fiber and so does not allow for fecal losses thus direct calorimetry would give systematic overestimates of the amount of fuel that actually enters the blood through digestion What are used instead are standardized chemical tests or an analysis of the recipe using reference tables for common ingredients to estimate the products digestible constituents protein carbohydrate fat etc These results are then converted into an equivalent energy value based on the following standardized table of energy densities However energy density is a misleading term for it once again assumes that energy is IN the particular food whereas it simply means that high density food needs more oxygen during respiration leading to greater transfer of energy Note that the following standardized table of energy densities is an approximation and the value in kJg does not convert exactly to kcalg using a conversion factor The use of such a simple system has been criticized for not taking into consideration other factors pertaining to the influence of different foods on obesity All the other nutrients in food are noncaloric and are thus not counted Recommended daily intake Increased mental activity has been linked with moderately increased brain energy consumption Older people and those with sedentary lifestyles require less energy children and physically active people require more Recommendations in the United States are 2600 and 2000\\xa0kcal 10900 and 8400\\xa0kJ for men and women respectively between 31 and 35 at a physical activity level equivalent to walking about 2 to 5\\xa0km 1\\xa01‚ÅÑ2 to 3\\xa0mi per day at 5 to 6\\xa0kmh 3 to 4\\xa0mph in addition to the light physical activity associated with typical daytoday life with French guidance suggesting roughly the same levels Recognizing that people of different age and gender groups have varying daily activity levels Australias National Health and Medical Research Council recommends no single daily energy intake but instead prescribes an appropriate recommendation for each age and gender group Notwithstanding nutrition labels on Australian food products typically recommend the average daily energy intake of 2100\\xa0kcal 8800\\xa0kJ According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations the average minimum energy requirement per person per day is about 7500\\xa0kJ 1800\\xa0kcal Energy usage in the human body  The human body uses the energy released by respiration for a wide range of purposes about 20 of the energy is used for brain metabolism and much of the rest is used for the basal metabolic requirements of other organs and tissues In cold environments metabolism may increase simply to produce heat to maintain body temperature Among the diverse uses for energy one is the production of mechanical energy by skeletal muscle to maintain posture and produce motion The conversion efficiency of energy from respiration into mechanical physical power depends on the type of food and on the type of physical energy usage eg which muscles are used whether the muscle is used aerobically or anaerobically In general the efficiency of muscles is rather low only 18 to 26 of the energy available from respiration is converted into mechanical energy This low efficiency is the result of about 40 efficiency of generating ATP from the respiration of food losses in converting energy from ATP into mechanical work inside the muscle and mechanical losses inside the body The latter two losses are dependent on the type of exercise and the type of muscle fibers being used fasttwitch or slowtwitch For an overall efficiency of 20 one watt of mechanical power is equivalent to 43\\xa0kcal 18\\xa0kJ per hour For example a manufacturer of rowing equipment shows calories released from burning food as four times the actual mechanical work plus 300\\xa0kcal 1300\\xa0kJ per hour which amounts to about 20 efficiency at 250 watts of mechanical output It can take up to 20 hours of little physical output eg walking to burn off 4000\\xa0kcal 17000\\xa0kJ more than a body would otherwise consume For reference each kilogram of body fat is roughly equivalent to 32300 kilojoules or 7700 kilocalories of food energy ie 3500 kilocalories per pound In addition the quality of calories matters because the energy absorption rate of different foods with equal amounts of calories may vary Some nutrients have regulatory roles affected by cell signaling in addition to providing energy for the body For example leucine plays an important role in the regulation of protein metabolism and suppresses an individuals appetite Swings in body temperature\\xa0‚Äì either hotter or cooler\\xa0‚Äì increase the metabolic rate thus burning more energy Prolonged exposure to extremely warm or very cold environments increases the basal metabolic rate BMR People who live in these types of settings often have BMRs 5‚Äì20 higher than those in other climates Physical activity also significantly increases body temperature which in turn uses more energy from respiration See also Atwater system Basal metabolic rate

organization that has advocated for the realization of the right to food for more than 25 years FIAN consists of national sections and individual members in over 50 countries around the world FIAN is a notforprofit organization without any religious or political affiliation and has consultative status to the United Nations FIAN‚Äôs mission is to expose violations of peoples right to food wherever they may occur The organization stands up against unjust and oppressive practices that prevent people from feeding themselves The struggle against gender discrimination and other forms of exclusion is integral part of its mission It strives to secure peoples access to the resources that they need in order to feed themselves now and in the future FIAN analyzes and documents concrete cases of violations of the right to food The organization raises awareness on the right to food among social movements nongovernmental organisations and governmental bodies and responds to requests from victim groups whose right to food is threatened or has been violated and mobilise support With protest letter campaigns advocacy and recourse to the law FIAN exerts public pressure in order to hold governments accountable for violations of the right to food FIAN follows up on cases until the victims get appropriate redress Within the United Nations system and other legal regimes the organization advocates respect of human rights in order to strengthen and improve the international human rights protection FIAN‚Äôs vision is a world free from hunger in which every woman man and child can fully enjoy their human rights in dignity particularly the right to adequate food as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments Organizational Structure FIAN is an international membership based organisation FIANs institutional members are its national sections which are legal entities in their own right and have their own membership and elected decisionmaking bodies Current sections of FIAN can be found in some 20 countries for updates look at Worldwide The overall mission vision and the strategy of FIAN is defined and revised by the International Council IC and represented by delegates of the sections who meet once in two years The IC elects the International Executive Committee IEC which is headed by the president and supervises the implementation of FIAN‚Äôs strategic plans The IEC meets biannually to review and strategize FIAN programs methods and budgets The operative working unit being in charge of the execution of FIAN‚Äôs programs is its International Secretariat IS located in Heidelberg Germany and Geneva Switzerland and coordinated by the Secretary General FIANs work FIAN uses various working tools to achieve the realization of the right to adequate food Casework and Interventions At international Fact Finding Missions FIAN identifies and addresses human rights violations FIAN interviews people threatened or affected by violations of their right to food and verifies the facts of a situation Facetoface contacts to local counterparts are established and serve as a basis for trustful cooperation On request of those affected FIAN reacts quickly analyses the case and mobilises members and supporters worldwide to send out Urgent Action protest letters Violations are also followedup in longterm casework by local FIAN action groups In close cooperation with the affected communities FIAN persistently approaches the responsible authorities and identifies breaches of right to food obligations FIAN‚Äôs analysis is based on the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights as interpreted in the UN General Comments in particular General Comment 12 on the right to adequate food Existing recourse mechanisms and legal remedies under national and international human rights law are applied to provide redress to the victims Lobby and Advocacy Reliable contacts and networks a sound documentation of cases and two decades of experience provide a solid basis for effective lobbying and advocating the right to food FIAN holds states international institutions and private actors accountable at the national and international levels The Right to Food Guidelines adopted by the FAO in 2004 is one of the tools FIAN uses to monitor states‚Äô right to food policies FIAN tries to improve the existing right to food protection system and to establish new instruments Intense followup work strives to secure the effective implementation of existing instruments making the right to food politically and judicially enforceable everywhere for everyone Information and Education Targeted information campaigns and awarenessraising on the right to food are at the core of FIAN‚Äôs work  to empower social movements and nongovernmental organizations to hold states accountable for violations of the right to food to clarify for governments and other dutybearers the content and implementation needs of their obligations and to motivate supporters from civil society to join action against human rights violations The systematic information gathered from more than 400

       "  'raw page text': 'Food frequency questionnaire FFQ is a questionnaire used to obtain frequency and in some cases portion size information about food and beverage consumption over a specified period of time typically the past month or year FFQs are a common dietary assessment tool used in large epidemiologic studies of diet and health Examples of usage include assessment of intake of vitamins and other nutrients assessment of the intake of toxins and estimating the prevalence of dietary patterns such as vegetarianism It is an example of a dietary assessment tool    Structure and data collected Questions A FFQ includes questions on a set of food and beverage items For each food or beverage item there may be questions asking about the following Frequency of consumption with a never option as well as options ranging from very infrequent to several times a day Portion size information which may be framed in terms of portion size for each round of consumption or total portion size Respondents may be asked to translate usual consumption amount to number of specified units such as a cup of rice Some questionnaires include portion size images such as photographs in an attempt to enhance reporting accuracy Other information such as frequency of consumption at particular times of the year or the subtype or brand that people consume In addition to foods and beverages FFQs often ask about the frequency of intake and dosages of commonly consumed dietary supplements Length and administration format A FFQ that aims to capture total dietary intake includes questions on 80 to 120 food and beverage items and takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete FFQs may be intervieweradministered in case of low literacy as well as when being conducted on children FFQs are intended for individual rather than household use ie they need to be answered for each individual food consumer For very young children the FFQ may be answered by a parent or guardian instead Types of FFQs FFQs are classified as Nonquantitative FFQs if they collect only frequency information and no portion size information and Semiquantitative FFQs if they collect information on both frequency and portion size Relation with other assessment tools Similar diet assessment tools FFQ is a common method for dietary assessment ie for constructing the respondents diet history Some other methods include 24hour diet recall This is a structured interview intended to capture detailed information about all the foods and beverages consumed by the respondent in the last 24 hours For young children the parent or guardian may respond on the childs behalf A variant of this method is the multiplepass recall Here after an initial recall the interviewer goes back to previous questions to clarify further details Other kinds of diet history interviews such as narrative diet histories Weighted food diary also called weighted food record The individual records details of food and beverage in the diary at the time of consumption A variant of this method is estimated food records where the quantification of food and drink is estimated rather than weighed Advantages and disadvantages relative to weighted food records FFQs as well as other retrospective diet assessment methods such as the 24hour diet recall and other diet history methods have the advantage that they do not directly affect the behavior of the respondent In contrast weighted food records may influence the participants eating behavior Weighted food records also carry a high respondent burden One disadvantage of FFQs and other retrospective methods is that they may be less accurate because participants are relying on memory rather than information recorded in real time Advantages and disadvantages relative to the 24hour diet recall FFQs have the following advantages They can better capture consumption of foods consumed occasionally or episodically than the 24hour diet recall For instance if people habitually consume alcohol more on Fridays then a 24hour diet recall conducted on Tuesday will underestimate the extent of alcohol consumption whereas a welldesigned FFQ can capture the information They are easier to administer to literate populations at large scale and also easier to process than diet recalls FFQs have many disadvantages Due to the longer time period involved FFQs are more dependent on people having good memory as well as being able to accurately estimate the frequency of rare events for instance being able to correctly judge whether they consume something once a month or once a week These are cognitively complex tasks that require good generic memory FFQs lack detailed information on how the food was prepared as well as information on exactly how much was consumed and when Since FFQs are limited to a fixed list of foods they may not capture eating patterns of people who have very different eating patterns FFQs are more subject than diet recalls to social desirability bias with people overreporting the extent of consumption of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables Validation of FFQs using other methods Due to some of the concerns surrounding the validity and reliability of FFQs research using a FFQ generally also tests the validity of the FFQ In a typical research design the FFQ is validated against another dietary assessment technique such as 24hour diet recall or weighted food records on a small population Once validated the FFQ can be distributed to a wider population with the same characteristics The need to validate FFQs against diet recalls or other more reliable methods is a recurrent theme in research and guidance on FFQs Food frequency questionnaires in use Specificity to populations Since FFQs list specific food and beverage items a FFQ designed for and validated against one population is not valid for other populations Therefore FFQs must be appropriately modified and revalidated against new populations A few key challenges include Different populations consume different sets of foods and beverages so the list of items in a FFQ validated against one population may not cover all the items for the other population Even when the items match in name the methods of preparation may differ significantly enough that results from one FFQ may not be applicable to a different FFQ Different populations use different languages so the FFQ needs to be translated Even when populations use the same language eg two Englishspeaking countries the jargon for specific food items can differ Thus for instance in order to administer the Diet History Questionnaire DHQ II in Canada a Canadian version CDHQII was created A number of standard FFQs are available for adults in the United States There is also research based on FFQs in the United Kingdom although weighted food records are more common there FFQs have also been developed in Sweden and other Northern and Western European countries There has been some research on FFQs in other regions such as the Middle East and Mediterranean Sri Lanka and Shanghai China Common FFQs in the United States The list below is drawn from existing lists of food frequency questionnaires All questionnaires in the list below are validated through multiple research studies Analysis of data Calculation of nutrient intake for semiquantitative FFQs Calculations for nutrient intake can be estimated via computerized software programs that multiply the reported frequency of each food by the amount of nutrient in a serving of that food References databases commonly used for this purpose are listed below Note that to estimate total nutrient intake it is necessary to include dietary supplements in the FFQ and add the nutrient intake from these particularly when dealing with populations where the consumption of dietary supplements is common The United States Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies FNDDS which in turn is based on the USDA National Nutrient Database To incorporate the effect of dietary supplements the USDA Dietary Supplement Integrated Database DSID can be used The University of Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center NCCs Food and Nutrient Database For nonquantitative FFQs nutrient intake cannot be calculated as accurately but the FFQ can still be used to get a rough idea of nutrient consumption Calculation of food groups consumed A related use of FFQs is to determine how much people consume broad groups of foods Examples of such food groups are fruits vegetables and added sugars A useful database for this purpose is the USDAs Food Patterns Equivalents Database FPED Comparison data In the United States data from NHANES is used to provide nationwide comparison data Populationlevel analyses FFQs can be used for a variety of populationlevel analyses Estimation of total consumption of specific foods food groups and nutrients in a population Estimation of the correlation between patterns of food consumption and other nondiet variables such as health status or specific medical conditions Estimation of the effectiveness of interventions to change diet In this experimental design both the experiment subjects and the control group are asked to fill in the FFQ before and after the intervention and changes in food consumption patterns for the experimental group are measured However because of concern about potential differential response bias due to the tendency of the intervention group to misreport their diets to a greater extent than the control group use of an FFQ or any selfreport dietary instrument as the sole evaluation method should be carefully considered Criticism The low validity of FFQs has made them a subject of criticism Walter Willett developer of the Harvard FFQ estimated a correlation of 060 to 070 between standard FFQs and diet recalls Alan R Kristal Ulrike Peters and John D Potter wrote in their article Is It Time to Abandon the Food Frequency Questionnaire that there was not much scope to learn more from FFQs and that a more curious and exploratory approach was needed to uncover new insights on diet and its correlation with health status The National Cancer Institute has argued that through careful bias correction some of the limitations of FFQs can be overcome and they can be very useful References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Fructose or fruit sugar is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides along with glucose and galactose that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion Fructose was discovered by French chemist AugustinPierre Dubrunfaut in 1847 The name fructose was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller Pure dry fructose is a very sweet white odorless crystalline solid and is the most watersoluble of all the sugars Fructose is found in honey tree and vine fruits flowers berries and most root vegetables Commercially fructose is frequently derived from sugar cane sugar beets and maize Crystalline fructose is the monosaccharide dried ground and of high purity Highfructose corn syrup HFCS is a mixture of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides Sucrose is a compound with one molecule of glucose covalently linked to one molecule of fructose All forms of fructose including fruits and juices are commonly added to foods and drinks for palatability and taste enhancement and for browning of some foods such as baked goods About 240000 tonnes of crystalline fructose are produced annually There is research indicating that excessive fructose consumption is a cause of insulin resistance obesity elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides leading to metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease However the European Food Safety Authority stated that fructose is preferable over sucrose and glucose in sugarsweetened foods and beverages because of its lower effect on postprandial blood sugar levels and also noted that high intakes of fructose may lead to metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia insulin resistance and increased visceral adiposity Further the UKs Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in 2015 disputed the claims of fructose causing metabolic disorders stating that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that fructose intake  leads to adverse health outcomes independent of any effects related to its presence as a component of total and free sugars    Chemical properties   Fructose is a 6carbon polyhydroxyketone Crystalline fructose adopts a cyclic sixmembered structure owing to the stability of its hemiketal and internal hydrogenbonding This form is formally called Dfructopyranose In solution fructose exists as an equilibrium mixture of 70 fructopyranose and about 22 fructofuranose as well as small amounts of three other forms including the acyclic structure Reactions Fructose and fermentation Fructose may be anaerobically fermented by yeast or bacteria Yeast enzymes convert sugar glucose or fructose to ethanol and carbon dioxide The carbon dioxide released during fermentation will remain dissolved in water where it will reach equilibrium with carbonic acid unless the fermentation chamber is left open to the air The dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid produce the carbonation in bottled fermented beverages Fructose and Maillard reaction Fructose undergoes the Maillard reaction nonenzymatic browning with amino acids Because fructose exists to a greater extent in the openchain form than does glucose the initial stages of the Maillard reaction occur more rapidly than with glucose Therefore fructose has potential to contribute to changes in food palatability as well as other nutritional effects such as excessive browning volume and tenderness reduction during cake preparation and formation of mutagenic compounds Dehydration Fructose readily dehydrates to give hydroxymethylfurfural HMF This process in the future may become part of a lowcost carbonneutral system to produce replacements for petrol and diesel from plants Physical and functional properties Sweetness of fructose  The primary reason that fructose is used commercially in foods and beverages besides its low cost is its high relative sweetness It is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates The relative sweetness of fructose has been reported in the range of 12‚Äì18 times that of sucrose However it is the 6membered ring form of fructose that is sweeter the 5membered ring form tastes about the same as usual table sugar Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5membered ring form Therefore the relative sweetness decreases with increasing temperature However it has been observed that the absolute sweetness of fructose is identical at 5\\xa0¬∞C as 50\\xa0¬∞C and thus the relative sweetness to sucrose is not due to anomeric distribution but a decrease in the absolute sweetness of sucrose at lower temperatures  The sweetness of fructose is perceived earlier than that of sucrose or glucose and the taste sensation reaches a peak higher than that of sucrose and diminishes more quickly than that of sucrose Fructose can also enhance other flavors in the system Fructose exhibits a sweetness synergy effect when used in combination with other sweeteners The relative sweetness of fructose blended with sucrose aspartame or saccharin is perceived to be greater than the sweetness calculated from individual components Fructose solubility and crystallization Fructose has higher solubility than other sugars as well as other sugar alcohols Fructose is therefore difficult to crystallize from an aqueous solution Sugar mixes containing fructose such as candies are softer than those containing other sugars because of the greater solubility of fructose Fructose hygroscopicity and humectancy Fructose is quicker to absorb moisture and slower to release it to the environment than sucrose glucose or other nutritive sweeteners Fructose is an excellent humectant and retains moisture for a long period of time even at low relative humidity RH Therefore fructose can contribute a more palatable texture and longer shelf life to the food products in which it is used Freezing point Fructose has a greater effect on freezing point depression than disaccharides or oligosaccharides which may protect the integrity of cell walls of fruit by reducing ice crystal formation However this characteristic may be undesirable in softserve or hardfrozen dairy desserts Fructose and starch functionality in food systems Fructose increases starch viscosity more rapidly and achieves a higher final viscosity than sucrose because fructose lowers the temperature required during gelatinizing of starch causing a greater final viscosity Although some artificial sweeteners are not suitable for homebaking many traditional recipes use fructose Food sources  Natural sources of fructose include fruits vegetables including sugar cane and honey Fructose is often further concentrated from these sources The highest dietary sources of fructose besides pure crystalline fructose are foods containing table sugar sucrose highfructose corn syrup agave nectar honey molasses maple syrup fruit and fruit juices as these have the highest percentages of fructose including fructose in sucrose per serving compared to other common foods and ingredients Fructose exists in foods either as a free monosaccharide or bound to glucose as sucrose a disaccharide Fructose glucose and sucrose may all be present in a food however different foods will have varying levels of each of these three sugars The sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in Table 1 In general in foods that contain free fructose the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 11 that is foods with fructose usually contain about an equal amount of free glucose A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose and below 1 a lower proportion Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others For example apples and pears contain more than twice as much free fructose as glucose while for apricots the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose Apple and pear juices are of particular interest to pediatricians because the high concentrations of free fructose in these juices can cause diarrhea in children The cells enterocytes that line childrens small intestines have less affinity for fructose absorption than for glucose and sucrose Unabsorbed fructose creates higher osmolarity in the small intestine which draws water into the gastrointestinal tract resulting in osmotic diarrhea This phenomenon is discussed in greater detail in the Health Effects section Table 1 also shows the amount of sucrose found in common fruits and vegetables Sugarcane and sugar beet have a high concentration of sucrose and are used for commercial preparation of pure sucrose Extracted cane or beet juice is clarified removing impurities and concentrated by removing excess water The endproduct is 999pure sucrose Sucrosecontaining sugars include common table white granulated sugar and powdered sugar as well as brown sugar A The carbohydrate figure is calculated in the USDA database and does not always correspond to the sum of the sugars the starch and the dietary fiber All data with a unit of g gram are based on 100\\xa0g of a food item The fructoseglucose ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of free fructose plus half sucrose by the sum of free glucose plus half sucrose Fructose is also found in the synthetically manufactured sweetener highfructose corn syrup HFCS Hydrolyzed corn starch is used as the raw material for production of HFCS Through the enzymatic treatment glucose molecules are converted into fructose There are three types of HFCS each with a different proportion of fructose HFCS42 HFCS55 and HFCS90 The number for each HFCS corresponds to the percentage of synthesized fructose present in the syrup HFCS90 has the highest concentration of fructose and typically is used to manufacture HFCS55 HFCS55 is used as sweetener in soft drinks whereas HFCS42 is used in many processed foods and baked goods Carbohydrate content of commercial sweeteners percent on dry basis Data obtained from Kretchmer N amp Hollenbeck CB 1991 Sugars and Sweeteners Boca Raton FL CRC Press Inc for HFCS and USDA for fruits and vegetables and the other refined sugars Cane and beet sugars have been used as the major sweetener in food manufacturing for centuries However with the development of HFCS a significant shift occurred in the type of sweetener consumption in certain countries particularly the United States As seen in Figure 3 this change happened in the 1970s Contrary to the popular belief however with the increase of HFCS consumption the total fructose intake relative to the total glucose intake has not dramatically changed Granulated sugar is 999pure sucrose which means that it has equal ratio of fructose to glucose The most commonly used forms of HFCS HFCS42 and HFCS55 have a roughly equal ratio of fructose to glucose with minor differences HFCS has simply replaced sucrose as a sweetener Therefore despite the changes in the sweetener consumption the ratio of glucose to fructose intake has remained relatively constant  Nutritional information Providing 368 kcal per 100 grams of dry powder table fructose has 95 the caloric value of sucrose by weight Fructose powder is 100 carbohydrates and supplies no nutrients in significant content table Fructose digestion and absorption in humans   Fructose exists in foods either as a monosaccharide free fructose or as a unit of a disaccharide sucrose Free fructose is absorbed directly by the intestine When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose it is digested broken down and then absorbed as free fructose As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit which are then each absorbed After absorption it enters the hepatic portal vein and is directed toward the liver The mechanism of fructose absorption in the small intestine is not completely understood Some evidence suggests active transport because fructose uptake has been shown to occur against a concentration gradient However the majority of research supports the claim that fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via facilitated transport involving GLUT5 transport proteins Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the enterocytes assisted by transport proteins Fructose may be transported out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either GLUT2 or GLUT5 although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose and therefore the majority of fructose is transported out of the enterocyte through GLUT2 Capacity and rate of absorption The absorption capacity for fructose in monosaccharide form ranges from less than 5\\xa0g to 50\\xa0g per individual serving and adapts with changes in dietary fructose intake Studies show the greatest absorption rate occurs when glucose and fructose are administered in equal quantities When fructose is ingested as part of the disaccharide sucrose absorption capacity is much higher because fructose exists in a 11 ratio with glucose It appears that the GLUT5 transfer rate may be saturated at low levels and absorption is increased through joint absorption with glucose One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is a glucosedependent cotransport of fructose In addition fructose transfer activity increases with dietary fructose intake The presence of fructose in the lumen causes increased mRNA transcription of GLUT5 leading to increased transport proteins Highfructose diets gt24 gkg body wt increase transport proteins within three days of intake Malabsorption  Several studies have measured the intestinal absorption of fructose using the hydrogen breath test These studies indicate that fructose is not completely absorbed in the small intestine When fructose is not absorbed in the small intestine it is transported into the large intestine where it is fermented by the colonic flora Hydrogen is produced during the fermentation process and dissolves into the blood of the portal vein This hydrogen is transported to the lungs where it is exchanged across the lungs and is measurable by the hydrogen breath test The colonic flora also produces carbon dioxide shortchain fatty acids organic acids and trace gases in the presence of unabsorbed fructose The presence of gases and organic acids in the large intestine causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating diarrhea flatulence and gastrointestial pain Exercise immediately after consumption can exacerbate these symptoms by decreasing transit time in the small intestine resulting in a greater amount of fructose emptied into the large intestine Fructose metabolism All three dietary monosaccharides are transported into the liver by the GLUT2 transporter Fructose and galactose are phosphorylated in the liver by fructokinase Km 05 mM and galactokinase Km  08 mM By contrast glucose tends to pass through the liver Km of hepatic glucokinase  10 mM and can be metabolised anywhere in the body Uptake of fructose by the liver is not regulated by insulin However insulin is capable of increasing the abundance and functional activity of GLUT5 in skeletal muscle cells Fructolysis  The initial catabolism of fructose is sometimes referred to as fructolysis in analogy with glycolysis the catabolism of glucose In fructolysis the enzyme fructokinase initially produces fructose 1phosphate which is split by aldolase B to produce the trioses dihydroxyacetone phosphate DHAP and glyceraldehyde 2 Unlike glycolysis in fructolysis the triose glyceraldehyde lacks a phosphate group A third enzyme triokinase is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde producing glyceraldehyde 3phosphate The resulting trioses are identical to those obtained in glycolysis and can enter the gluconeogenic pathway for glucose or glycogen synthesis or be further catabolized through the lower glycolytic pathway to pyruvate Metabolism of fructose to DHAP and glyceraldehyde The first step in the metabolism of fructose is the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1phosphate by fructokinase thus trapping fructose for metabolism in the liver Fructose 1phosphate then undergoes hydrolysis by aldolase B to form DHAP and glyceraldehydes DHAP can either be isomerized to glyceraldehyde 3phosphate by triosephosphate isomerase or undergo reduction to glycerol 3phosphate by glycerol 3phosphate dehydrogenase The glyceraldehyde produced may also be converted to glyceraldehyde 3phosphate by glyceraldehyde kinase or further converted to glycerol 3phosphate by glycerol 3phosphate dehydrogenase The metabolism of fructose at this point yields intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway leading to glycogen synthesis as well as fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis Synthesis of glycogen from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3phosphate The resultant glyceraldehyde formed by aldolase B then undergoes phosphorylation to glyceraldehyde 3phosphate Increased concentrations of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3phosphate in the liver drive the gluconeogenic pathway toward glucose and subsequent glycogen synthesis It appears that fructose is a better substrate for glycogen synthesis than glucose and that glycogen replenishment takes precedence over triglyceride formation Once liver glycogen is replenished the intermediates of fructose metabolism are primarily directed toward triglyceride synthesis  Synthesis of triglyceride from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3phosphate Carbons from dietary fructose are found in both the free fatty acid and glycerol moieties of plasma triglycerides High fructose consumption can lead to excess pyruvate production causing a buildup of Krebs cycle intermediates Accumulated citrate can be transported from the mitochondria into the cytosol of hepatocytes converted to acetyl CoA by citrate lyase and directed toward fatty acid synthesis In addition DHAP can be converted to glycerol 3phosphate providing the glycerol backbone for the triglyceride molecule Triglycerides are incorporated into verylowdensity lipoproteins VLDL which are released from the liver destined toward peripheral tissues for storage in both fat and muscle cells  Potential health effects Digestion Fructose absorption occurs in the small intestine via the GLUT5 fructose only transporter and the GLUT2 transporter for which it competes with glucose and galactose Overconsumption of fructose inhibition of GLUT2 by other phytochemicals such as flavonoids or other issues may result in delivery of unabsorbed fructose into the large intestine which will cause more water to be drawn into the large intestine through the process of osmosis causing diarrhea In addition the excessive fructose becomes a source of nutrients for the gut flora resulting in a higher production of short chain fatty acids hydrogen carbon dioxide and other gases due to fermentation This increase of gas causes gastrointestinal side effects that mimic irritable bowel syndrome Weight gain In a metaanalysis of clinical trials with controlled feeding ‚Äî where test subjects were fed a fixed amount of energy rather than being allowed to choose the amount they ate ‚Äî fructose was not an independent factor for weight gain however fructose consumption was associated with weight gain when the fructose provided excess calories Cardiometabolic diseases Excess fructose consumption has been hypothesized to be a cause of insulin resistance obesity elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides leading to metabolic syndrome In preliminary research fructose consumption was correlated with obesity Fructose encourages visceral adipose tissue deposition in humans Studies indicate that there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular disease from a high intake of fructose Studies have associated high fructose consumption with increased incidence of hypertension both acutely  and in the long term in subjects without a history of hypertension The mechanistic link for this is thought to be the increased production of uric acid a known predictor for hypertension The elevation in uric acid is due to unregulated phosphorylation leading to depletion of ATP and subsequent ADP degradation to uric acid Another study in humans concluded that fructose and sucrose are metabolized similarly whereas a different analysis produced significantly higher fasting plasma triglyceride values than did the glucose diet in men and if plasma triacylglycerols are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease then diets high in fructose may be undesirable A study in 2015 later confirmed this by showing that consuming beverages with high levels of highfructose corn syrup caused heightened levels of LDL cholesterol nonHDL cholesterol apolipoprotein B all of which are lipidlipoproteins risk factors for cardiovascular disease In contrast to the above claims of fructose contributing to cardiometabolic diseases an expert panel of the European Food Safety Authority concluded that fructose be preferred in food and beverage manufacturing to replace sucrose and glucose due to the lower effect of fructose on blood glucose levels following a meal Compared with sucrose Fructose is often recommended for diabetics because it does not trigger the production of insulin by pancreatic Œ≤ cells probably because Œ≤ cells have low levels of GLUT5 although the net effect for both diabetics and nondiabetics is debated Fructose has a low glycemic index of 19 ¬± 2 compared with 100 for glucose and 68 ¬± 5 for sucrose Fructose is also 73 sweeter than sucrose at room temperature so diabetics can use less of it Studies show that fructose consumed before a meal may even lessen the glycemic response of the meal Fructosesweetened food and beverage products cause less of a rise in blood glucose levels than do those manufactured with sucrose or glucose Liver function Excessive fructose consumption may contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Gout A 2008 study found a risk of incident gout associated with high consumption of fructose or fructoserich foods Glycemic index Fructose has the lowest glycemic index GI  19 of all the natural sugars In comparison ordinary table sugar sucrose which is half fructose has a GI of 65 and honey usually about 50 fructose content has a GI of 55 Appetite control Compared with consumption of high glucose beverages drinking highfructose beverages with meals results in lower circulating insulin and leptin levels and higher ghrelin levels after the meal Since leptin and insulin decrease appetite and ghrelin increases appetite some researchers suspect that eating large amounts of fructose increases the likelihood of weight gain See also Hereditary fructose intolerance Inverted sugar syrup References  External

decisionmaking about food and beverage purchases Functional drinks are advertised as having various health benefits For example some claim to improve heart health immunity digestion and joint health while others promote themselves as satiating and energyboosting Industry The functional beverage industry is a subsector of the functional food and nonalcoholic beverage industry It is the fastestgrowing sector of the industry partially due to the maturity of the carbonated soft drink sector and heavy investments by major food and beverage companies Another reason for the industrys growth may be the consumeroriented market scheme whereby innovative ideas come from consumers By 2008 in the US the market share of functional beverages accounted for 489 of the nonalcoholic industry which is worth 1183 billion In 2006 functional beverage consumption per capita rose to 664 gallons while the carbonated soft drink sector saw a decline in percapita consumption to 504 gallons decreased from an average percapita consumption of 1925 gallons in 2006 Functional beverage industry players are generally categorized into four types Traditional nonalcoholic beverage companies like

healthy ingredients Consider extensions of existing brand lines For example Nestle extended their Boost product line by adding Kids Essentials to the line thereby extending the adultfocused Boost line to a new market children Larger companies compete for market share by acquiring smaller companies that may own a particular market sector For example CocaCola purchased Glaceau from Energy Brands and Odwalla and Fuze Beverage from their respective founders in order to increase CocaColas market share Explore new functional brands by identifying new markets and demands Market segments of the functional beverage industry are divided mainly into four parts Those include hydration energyrejuvenation health and wellness and weight management Each segment has its own target market and consumers Overlapping of target consumers does occur‚Äînot because of undefined market needs but due to consumer acceptance of functional beverages Hydration Recently there has been an increase in the promotion of hydration drinks For example in 2008 Nestl√© launched Glowelle which it marketed as an exclusive hydration drink sold only in Neiman Marcus stores Among the drinks ingredient list were antioxidant vitamins and fruit extracts which the company claims hydrate the inner and outer layer of the skin and protect drinkers from free radicals Gatorade has also created several drinks marketed as hydration beverages with various health benefits Its Thirst Quencher drinks according to advertisements each contain an excellent source of various vitamins 25 of the RDI of B vitamins including vitamins B3 B5 and B6 20 of the RDI of the antioxidant vitamin E and 20 of the RDI of vitamin C In tandem with these adjustments a lowcalorie version called G2 was also reformulated According to Gatorade G2 now also provides an excellent source 25 of the RDI of B vitamins including vitamins B3 B5 and B6 and a good source 10 of the RDI of vitamins C and E Gatorades new products are a good example of the first major strategy of competition listed in the Market section above By reformulating its products Gatorades goals were to promote their own new products as healthier and to emphasize the healthy ingredients in the drinks Energy and stimulation Highly caffeinated often highly sweetened energy drinks have become popular on the beverage market in the United States as well as globally in the past decade Consumer demand has helped generate a new generation of energy drink brands containing similar amounts of caffeine calories and sugar Various stimulants found in energy drinks include taurine glucoronolactone caffeine B vitamins guarana ginseng ginkgo biloba Lcarnitine sugars antioxidants yerba mat√© creatine and milk thistle Although these ingredients have been approved by the FDA health experts still recommend that consumers read their energy drinks labels as these ingredients may not improve health Health and wellness Healthconscious individuals are among the target consumers of many functional beverage companies To target these individuals many companies have introduced functional beverages which contain less sugar and therefore less calories For example VitaminWater 10 contains only 10 calories per serving 25 calories for a 351mL bottle with 75\\xa0grams of sugar An entire bottle also contains 250 of the RDI of vitamin C and 25 of the RDI of vitamins B3 B5 B6 and B12 VitaminWater 10 lowered its calorie content by using an allnatural sweetener stevia extracted from the Stevia rebaudiana plant This also makes it possible for the company to advertise VitaminWater 10 as natural Weight management With increased worries about obesity and its implications on health combined with consumer demand for convenience goods consumer demand has increased for easy weight loss methods that can be easily integrated into daily lifestyles Functional beverages are striving to market themselves as such by adding ingredients that are claimed to promote weight loss For example Nestl√© and The CocaCola Company have partnered to produce Enviga which they describe as a calorieburning beverage Skinny Water owned by Skinny Nutritional Corp and Nutrisodas Slenderized owned by PepsiCo have both used a polyphenol called epigallocatechin gallate EGCG in their products for their metabolize boosting sic effect A tea extract called Blue California which has a 95 EGCG content is now on the market Some investigators report slimming actions induced by chlorogenic acids from green coffee but further investigations need to be performed Sales As of 2008 based on dollar sales the most popular functional beverages in order were Health and wellness drinks with 622 of dollar sales Hydration drinks 28 EnergyRejuvenation drinks 84 Weight Management drinks 12 Consumer demographic According to a 2006 article the functional beverage markets consumer group is characterized as welleducated females aged 35‚Äì55 belonging to the upper middle middle and lower middle classes This is thought to result from this groups perceptions that functional drinks produce positive health beliefs as well as their relatively high disposable income A 2002 article stated that within the energy and stimulant drink sector young adults aged 18 to 34 are considered to be the main target market as evidenced by high consumption rates However due to constant changes in attitudes about different types of functional beverages these target markets could change Health concerns Health experts are concerned about the increased consumption and popularity of functional beverages Although these beverages may serve to hydrate the individual they may not mitigate or even address todays major health issues such as obesity heart disease and cancer Most functional beverages are sweetened and consumption of sweetened beverages is associated with higher levels of obesity and heart disease Most of these drinks contain significant amounts of sugars and hence calories which would add to discretionary and total caloric intake As such these ingredients pose health risks because of what they contain sugar and caffeine or what they replace in the diet vitamin and mineralrich foods Another set of concerns is that some functional beverages contain ingredients that have not been sufficiently studied for health benefits safety and dosage At the same time many functional beverages have higher levels of a certain ingredient like caffeine‚Äîwhich when consumed in large amounts is associated with heart disease and cancer  Sugar content Many functional drinks have high levels of sugar even if they have other healthy ingredients For example a 20oz bottle of Glac√©aus VitaminWater has been reported to contain approximately 33 g of sugar which is similar to the sugar content of a can of CocaCola This prompted The CocaCola Company to be sued for claiming that VitaminWater was a healthy beverage Given their sugar content many functional beverages may not be as healthy an alternative as other commonly consumed beverages In addition the sugar content of such beverages promotes dental cavities amongst frequent users Energy drinks  In some functional beverages particularly energy drinks the caffeine content can be high ranging from 0‚Äì1411 milligrams per serving This can be more than an average 8ounce cup of coffee which contains about 133\\xa0mg of caffeine There have been reports to Health Canada of adverse reactions involving energy drinks See also  Functional food References  External links Functional drinks ‚Äì specialist news analysis

       "  'raw page text': 'Galactose galacto  ose milk sugar sometimes abbreviated Gal is a monosaccharide sugar that is about as sweet as glucose and about 65 as sweet as sucrose It is a C4 epimer of glucose Galactan is a polymeric form of galactose found in hemicellulose and forming the core of the galactans a class of natural polymeric carbohydrates    Structure and isomerism Galactose exists in both openchain and cyclic form The openchain form has a carbonyl at the end of the chain Four isomers are cyclic two of them with a pyranose sixmembered ring two with a furanose fivemembered ring Galactofuranose occurs in bacteria fungi and protozoa  and is recognized by a putative chordate immune lectin intelectin through its exocyclic 12diol In the cyclic form there are two anomers named alpha and beta since the transition from the openchain form to the cyclic form involves the creation of a new stereocenter at the site of the openchain carbonyl In the beta form the alcohol group is in the equatorial position whereas in the alpha form the alcohol group is in the axial position   Relationship to lactose Galactose is a monosaccharide When combined with glucose monosaccharide through a condensation reaction the result is the disaccharide lactose The hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose is catalyzed by the enzymes lactase and Œ≤galactosidase The latter is produced by the lac operon in Escherichia coli In nature lactose is found primarily in milk and milk products Consequently various food products made with dairyderived ingredients can contain lactose Galactose metabolism which converts galactose into glucose is carried out by the three principal enzymes in a mechanism known as the Leloir pathway The enzymes are listed in the order of the metabolic pathway galactokinase GALK galactose1phosphate uridyltransferase GALT and UDPgalactose4‚Äôepimerase GALE In human lactation glucose is changed into galactose via hexoneogenesis to enable the mammary glands to secrete lactose However most lactose in breast milk is synthesized from galactose taken up from the blood and only 35¬±6 is made from galactose from de novo synthesis  Glycerol also contributes some to the mammary galactose production Metabolism  Glucose is the primary metabolic fuel for humans It is more stable than galactose and is less susceptible to the formation of nonspecific glycoconjugates molecules with at least one sugar attached to a protein or lipid Many speculate that it is for this reason that a pathway for rapid conversion from galactose to glucose has been highly conserved among many species The main pathway of galactose metabolism is the Leloir pathway humans and other species however have been noted to contain several alternate pathways such as the De Ley Doudoroff pathway The Leloir pathway consists of the latter stage of a twopart process that converts Œ≤Dgalactose to UDPglucose The initial stage is the conversion of Œ≤Dgalactose to Œ±Dgalactose by the enzyme mutarotase GALM The Leloir pathway then carries out the conversion of Œ±Dgalactose to UDPglucose via three principal enzymes Galactokinase GALK phosphorylates Œ±Dgalactose to galactose1phosphate or Gal1P Galactose1phosphate uridyltransferase GALT transfers a UMP group from UDPglucose to Gal1P to form UDPgalactose and finally UDP galactose4‚Äôepimerase GALE interconverts UDPgalactose and UDPglucose thereby completing the pathway Galactosemia is an inability to properly break down galactose due to a genetically inherited mutation in one of the enzymes in the Leloir pathway As a result the consumption of even small quantities is harmful to galactosemics Sources Galactose is found in dairy products avocados sugar beets other gums and mucilages It is also synthesized by the body where it forms part of glycolipids and glycoproteins in several tissues and is a byproduct from the thirdgeneration ethanol production process from macroalgae Clinical significance Chronic systemic exposure of mice rats and Drosophila to Dgalactose causes the acceleration of senescence aging and has been used as an aging model Two studies have suggested a possible link between galactose in milk and ovarian cancer Other studies show no correlation even in the presence of defective galactose metabolism More recently pooled analysis done by the Harvard School of Public Health showed no specific correlation between lactosecontaining foods and ovarian cancer and showed statistically insignificant increases in risk for consumption of lactose at 30 gd More research is necessary to ascertain possible risks Some ongoing studies suggest galactose may have a role in treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis a kidney disease resulting in kidney failure and proteinuria This effect is likely to be a result of binding of galactose to FSGS factor Galactose is a component of the antigens present on blood cells that determine blood type within the ABO blood group system In O and A antigens there are two monomers of galactose on the antigens whereas in the B antigens there are three monomers of galactose A disaccharide composed of two units of galactose galactosealpha13galactose alphagal has been recognized as a potential allergen present in mammal meat Alphagal allergy may be triggered by lone star tick bites History In 1855 E O Erdmann noted that hydrolysis of lactose produced a substance besides glucose Galactose was first isolated and studied by Louis Pasteur in 1856 He called it lactose In 1860 Berthelot renamed it galactose or glucose lactique In 1894 Emil Fischer and Robert Morrell determined the configuration of galactose See also Galactolysis Lgalactose References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Glucose is a simple sugar with the molecular formula C6H12O6 which means that it is a molecule that is made of 6 carbon atoms twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar It is made during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide using energy from sunlight It is the most important source of energy for cellular respiration Glucose is stored as a polymer in plants as starch and in animals as glycogen With 6 carbon atoms it is classed as a hexose a subcategory of the monosaccharides DGlucose is one of the 16 aldohexose stereoisomers The Disomer Dglucose also known as dextrose occurs widely in nature but the Lisomer Lglucose does not Glucose can be obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as milk sugar lactose cane sugar sucrose maltose cellulose glycogen etc It is commonly commercially manufactured from cornstarch by hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled pH in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization In 1747 Andreas Marggraf was the first to isolate glucose Glucose is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines the most important medications needed in a basic health system The name glucose derives through the French from the Greek Œ≥ŒªœÖŒ∫œåœÇ which means sweet in reference to must the sweet first press of grapes in the making of wine The suffix ose is a chemical classifier denoting a carbohydrate    Function in biology Glucose is the most widely used aldohexose in living organisms One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the amine groups of proteins This reaction ‚Äì glycation ‚Äì impairs or destroys the function of many proteins Glucoses low rate of glycation can be attributed to its having a more stable cyclic form compared to other aldohexoses which means it spends less time than they do in its reactive openchain form The reason for glucose having the most stable cyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its hydroxy groups with the exception of the hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of Dglucose are in the equatorial position Many of the longterm complications of diabetes eg blindness renal failure and peripheral neuropathy are probably due to the glycation of proteins or lipids In contrast enzymeregulated addition of sugars to protein is called glycosylation and is essential for the function of many proteins Energy source Glucose is an ubiquitous fuel in biology It is used as an energy source in most organisms from bacteria to humans through either aerobic respiration anaerobic respiration or fermentation Glucose is the human bodys key source of energy through aerobic respiration providing about 375\\xa0kilocalories 16\\xa0kilojoules of food energy per gram Breakdown of carbohydrates eg starch yields mono and disaccharides most of which is glucose Through glycolysis and later in the reactions of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation glucose is oxidized to eventually form CO2 and water yielding energy mostly in the form of ATP The insulin reaction and other mechanisms regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood Glucose supplies almost all the energy for the brain so its availability influences psychological processes When glucose is low psychological processes requiring mental effort eg selfcontrol effortful decisionmaking are impaired  As a result of its importance in human health glucose is an analyte in common medical blood tests Eating or fasting prior to taking a blood sample has an effect on analyses for glucose in the blood a high fasting glucose blood sugar level may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus Glycolysis   Use of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration anaerobic respiration or fermentation All of these processes follow from an earlier metabolic pathway known as glycolysis The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose by a hexokinase to form glucose 6phosphate The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged phosphate group prevents glucose 6phosphate from easily crossing the cell membrane Furthermore addition of the highenergy phosphate group activates glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis At physiological conditions this initial reaction is irreversible In anaerobic respiration one glucose molecule produces a net gain of two ATP molecules four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis through substratelevel phosphorylation but two are required by enzymes used during the process In aerobic respiration a molecule of glucose is much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules depending on the organism through oxidative phosphorylation is generated Click on genes proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles   Precursors Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances Starch cellulose and glycogen animal starch are common glucose polymers polysaccharides Some of these polymers starch or glycogen serve as energy stores while others cellulose and chitin which is made from a derivative of glucose have structural roles Oligosaccharides of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores These include lactose the predominant sugar in milk which is a glucosegalactose disaccharide and sucrose another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and fructose Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and lipids in a process called glycosylation This is often critical for their functioning The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use phosphorylated glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucosephosphate bond Other than its direct use as a monomer glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules This is important as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon Glucose can be broken down and converted into lipids It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C ascorbic acid Medical uses Glucose in diabetes Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure by cells in the body to respond properly to insulin Both of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance The pancreas is the organ responsible for the secretion of insulin Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels allowing the bodys cells to absorb and use glucose Without it glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the bodys functions If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels the insulinproducing cells in the pancreas could be damaged causing a lack of insulin in the body Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels Eventually the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucoselowering effect and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout and the disease progression of diabetes To monitor the bodys response to blood glucoselowering therapy glucose levels can be measured Blood glucose monitoring can be performed by multiple methods such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting Another test is the 2hour glucose tolerance test GTT ‚Äì for this test the person has a fasting glucose test done then drinks a 75gram glucose drink and is retested This test measures the ability of the persons body to process glucose Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream Hypoglycemia management Individuals with diabetes or other conditions where hypoglycemia low blood sugar may occur often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms One sugar commonly used is glucose often in the form of glucose tablets glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder hard candy or sugar packet Structure and nomenclature Glucose is a monosaccharide with formula C6H12O6 or HCOCHOH5H whose five hydroxyl OH groups are arranged in a specific way along its sixcarbon back Openchain form   In its fleeting openchain form the glucose molecule has an open as opposed to cyclic and unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms C1 through C6 where C1 is part of an aldehyde group HCO and each of the other five carbons bears one hydroxyl group OH The remaining bonds of the backbone carbons are satisfied by hydrogen atoms H Therefore glucose is both a hexose and an aldose or an aldohexose The aldehyde group makes glucose a reducing sugar giving a positive reaction with the Fehling test Each of the four carbons C2 through C5 is a stereocenter meaning that its four bonds connect to four different substituents Carbon C2 for example connects to COH OH H and CHOH4H In Dglucose these four parts must be in a specific threedimensional arrangement Namely when the molecule is drawn in the Fischer projection the hydroxyls on C2 C4 and C5 must be on the right side while that on C3 must be on the left side The positions of those four hydroxyls are exactly reversed in the Fischer diagram of Lglucose D and Lglucose are two of the 16 possible aldohexoses the other 14 are allose altrose mannose gulose idose galactose and talose each with two enantiomers D and L     It is important to note that the linear form of glucose makes up less than 3 of the glucose molecules in a water solution The rest is one of two cyclic forms of glucose that are formed when the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 C5 bonds to the aldehyde carbon 1 C1 Cyclic forms  In solutions the openchain form of glucose either D or L exists in equilibrium with several cyclic isomers each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom In aqueous solution however more than 99 of glucose molecules at any given time exist as pyranose forms The openchain form is limited to about 025 and furanose forms exists in negligible amounts The terms glucose and Dglucose are generally used for these cyclic forms as well The ring arises from the openchain form by an intramolecular nucleophilic addition reaction between the aldehyde group at C1 and either the C4 or C5 hydroxyl group forming a hemiacetal linkage COHHO The reaction between C1 and C5 yields a sixmembered heterocyclic system called a pyranose which is a monosaccharide sugar hence ‚Äìose containing a derivatised pyran skeleton The much rarer reaction between C1 and C4 yields a fivemembered furanose ring named after the cyclic ether furan In either case each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached except for the last carbon C4 or C5 where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule which is CCH2OHHOHH or CHOHH respectively The ringclosing reaction makes carbon C1 chiral too since its four bonds lead to H to OH to carbon C2 and to the ring oxygen These four parts of the molecule may be arranged around C1 the anomeric carbon in two distinct ways designated by the prefixes Œ± and Œ≤ When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the Haworth projection the designation Œ± means that the hydroxyl group attached to C1 and the CH2OH group at C5 lies on opposite sides of the rings plane a trans arrangement while Œ≤ means that they are on the same side of the plane a cis arrangement Therefore the openchain isomer Dglucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers Œ±Dglucopyranose Œ≤Dglucopyranose Œ±Dglucofuranose and Œ≤Dglucofuranose These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid catalysis  The other openchain isomer Lglucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of Lglucose each the mirror image of the corresponding Dglucose  The rings are not planar but are twisted in three dimensions The glucopyranose ring Œ± or Œ≤ can assume several nonplanar shapes analogous to the chair and boat conformations of cyclohexane Similarly the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes analogous to the envelope conformations of cyclopentane In the solid state only the glucopyranose forms are observed forming colorless crystalline solids that are highly soluble in water and acetic acid but poorly soluble in methanol and ethanol They melt at 146\\xa0¬∞C 295\\xa0¬∞F Œ± and 150\\xa0¬∞C 302\\xa0¬∞F Œ≤ and decompose at higher temperatures into carbon and water Rotational isomers Each glucose isomer is subject to rotational isomerism Within the cyclic form of glucose rotation may occur around the O6C6C5O5 torsion angle termed the œâangle to form three staggered rotamer conformations called gauchegauche gg gauchetrans gt and transgauche tg There is a tendency for the œâangle to adopt a gauche conformation a tendency that is attributed to the gauche effect Physical properties Solutions  All forms of glucose are colorless and easily soluble in water acetic acid and several other solvents They are only sparingly soluble in methanol and ethanol The openchain form is thermodynamically unstable and it spontaneously isomerizes to the cyclic forms Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four or threeatom rings these would be highly strained and are not observed in practice In solutions at room temperature the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours in a process called mutarotation Starting from any proportions the mixture converges to a stable ratio of Œ±Œ≤ 3664 The ratio would be Œ±Œ≤ 1189 if it were not for the influence of the anomeric effect Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to 0\\xa0¬∞C 32\\xa0¬∞F Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ringforming reaction resulting in the openchain form followed by a reforming of the ring The ring closure step may use a different OH group than the one recreated by the opening step thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms or the new hemiacetal group created on C1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one thus switching between the Œ± and Œ≤ forms Thus though the openchain form is barely detectable in solution it is an essential component of the equilibrium Solid state Depending on conditions three major solid forms of glucose can be crystallised from water solutions Œ±glucopyranose Œ≤glucopyranose and Œ≤glucopyranose hydrate Optical activity Whether in water or in the solid form D  glucose is dextrorotatory meaning it will rotate the direction of polarized light clockwise The effect is due to the chirality of the molecules and indeed the mirrorimage isomer L glucose is levorotatory rotates polarized light counterclockwise by the same amount The strength of the effect is different for each of the five tautomers Note that the D prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound It indicates that the C5 chiral center has the same handedness as that of Dglyceraldehyde which was so labeled because it is dextrorotatory The fact that Dglucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centers not just of C5 and indeed some of the other Daldohexoses are levorotatory Production Biosynthesis In plants and some prokaryotes glucose is a product of photosynthesis Photosynthesis is when plants use sunlight to convert six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules into one glucose molecule and six oxygen molecules Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucose‚Äîglycogen in animals and fungi or starch in plants the cleavage of glycogen is termed glycogenolysis of starch starch degradation In animals glucose is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from noncarbohydrate intermediates such as pyruvate lactate and glycerol in the process of gluconeogenesis In some deepsea bacteria glucose is produced by chemosynthesis Commercial Glucose is produced commercially via the enzymatic hydrolysis of starch Many crops can be used as the source of starch Maize rice wheat cassava corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world In the United States corn starch from maize is used almost exclusively Most commercial glucose occurs as a component of invert sugar a roughly 11 mixture of glucose and fructose In principle cellulose could be hydrolysed to glucose but this process is not yet commercially practical Glucose syrup also known as corn syrup is essentially a purified aqueous solution of saccharides obtained from edible starch that has a dextrose equivalency DE of 20 or more Dried corn syrup is glucose syrup with the water removed Glucose has a DE of 100 dried maltodextrin has a DE of less than 20 Corn syrup itself has a DE between 20 and 95 Sources and absorption Most dietary carbohydrates contain glucose either as their only building block as in the polysaccharides starch and glycogen or together with another monosaccharide as in the heteropolysaccharides sucrose and lactose In the lumen of the duodenum and small intestine the glucose oligo and polysaccharides are broken down to monosaccharides by the pancreatic and intestinal glycosidases Other polysaccharides cannot be processed by the human intestine and require assistance by intestinal flora if they are to be broken down the most notable exceptions are sucrose fructoseglucose and lactose galactoseglucose Glucose is then transported across the apical membrane of the enterocytes by SLC5A1 SGLT1 and later across their basal membrane by SLC2A2 GLUT2 Some glucose is converted to lactic acid by astrocytes which is then utilized as an energy source by brain cells some glucose is used by intestinal cells and red blood cells while the rest reaches the liver adipose tissue and muscle cells where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen under the influence of insulin Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes In fat cells glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some fat types and have other purposes Glycogen is the bodys glucose energy storage mechanism because it is much more space efficient and less reactive than glucose itself  History Glucose was first isolated from raisins in 1747 by the German chemist Andreas Marggraf Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms a correct understanding of its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in organic chemistry This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of Emil Fischer a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his findings The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of Jacobus Henricus van t Hoffs theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbonbearing molecules Between 1891 and 1894 Fischer established the stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible isomers applying van t Hoffs theory of asymmetrical carbon atoms Research Glucose physical and chemical properties have been used to build a computational model of proteinglucose bindingsites

plant compounds Some glucosinolates Sinigrin is the precursor to allyl isothiocyanate Glucotropaeolin is the precursor to benzyl isothiocyanate Gluconasturtiin is the precursor to phenethyl isothiocyanate Glucoraphanin is the precursor to sulforaphane Plants with glucosinolates Glucosinolates occur as secondary metabolites of almost all plants of the order Brassicales Ordered in the Brassicales are for example the exonomically important family Brassicaceae as well as Capparaceae and Caricaceae Outside of the Brassicales the genera Drypetes and Putranjiva in the family Putranjivaceae are the only other known occurrence of glucosinolates Glucosinolates occur in various edible plants such as cabbage white cabbage Chinese cabbage broccoli watercress horseradish capers and radishes where the breakdown products often contribute a significant part of the distinctive taste Diamondback moths which are pests of cruciferous plants may recognize the presence of glucosinolates allowing them to identify the proper host plant The glucosinolates are also found in seeds of these plants Biochemistry Natural diversity from a few amino acids About 132 different glucosinolates are known to occur naturally in plants They are synthesized from certain amino acids Socalled aliphatic glucosinolates derived from mainly methionine but also alanine leucine isoleucine or valine Most glucosinolates are actually derived from chainelongated homologues of these amino acids eg glucoraphanin is derived from dihomomethionine which is methionine chainelongated twice Aromatic glucosinolates include indolic glucosinolates such as glucobrassicin derived from tryptophan and others from phenylalanine its chainelongated homologue homophenylalanine and sinalbin derived from tyrosine Enzymatic activation The plants contain the enzyme myrosinase which in the presence of water cleaves off the glucose group from a glucosinolate The remaining molecule then quickly converts to an isothiocyanate a nitrile or a thiocyanate these are the active substances that serve as defense for the plant Glucosinolates are also called mustard oil glycosides The standard product of the reaction is the isothiocyanate mustard oil the other two products mainly occur in the presence of specialised plant proteins that alter the outcome of the reaction  To prevent damage to the plant itself the myrosinase and glucosinolates are stored in separate compartments of the cell and come together only or mainly under conditions of physical injury Biological effects Humans and other mammals Toxicity The use of glucosinolatecontaining crops as primary food source for animals can have negative effects if the concentration of glucosinolate is higher than what is acceptable for the animal in question Some glucosinolates have been shown to have toxic effects mainly as goitrogens in both humans and animals at high doses However tolerance level to glucosinolates varies even within the same genus eg Acomys cahirinus and Acomys russatus Taste and eating behavior The glucosinolate sinigrin among others was shown to be responsible for the bitterness of cooked cauliflower and Brussels sprouts Glucosinolate have been shown to alter animal eating behavior Research Plants producing large amounts of glucosinolates are under basic research for potential actions against cancer with the hydrolysis product of the glucoraphanin the primary glucosinolate in broccoli sulforaphane being the best known example Most recently a randomized controlled study evaluating the effects of broccoli seed supplementation on autism spectrum disorder is underway The makeup of glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products varies by vegetable Insects Substances derived from plants producing large amounts of glucosinolates can serve as natural pesticides A characteristic specialised insect fauna is found on glucosinolatecontaining plants including familiar butterflies such as large white small white and orange tip but also certain aphids moths such as the southern armyworm saw flies flea beetles etc For instance the large white butterfly oviposits its eggs on these glucosinolatecontaining plants because they help the larvae survive The biochemical basis of these specialisations are being unraveled The whites and orange tips all possess the socalled nitrile specifier protein which diverts glucosinolate hydrolysis toward nitriles rather than reactive isothiocyanates In contrast the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella possesses a completely different protein glucosinolate sulfatase which desulfates glucosinolates thereby making them unfit for degradation to toxic products by myrosinase Other kinds of insects specialised sawflies and aphids sequester glucosinolates In specialised aphids but not in sawflies a distinct animalmyrosinase is found in muscle tissue leading to degradation of sequestered glucosinolates upon aphid tissue destruction This diverse panel of biochemical solutions to the same plant chemical plays a key role in current attempts to understand the evolution of plantinsect relationships See also Isothiocyanate

       "  'raw page text': 'Gluten from Latin gluten glue is a composite of storage proteins termed prolamins and glutelins and stored together with starch in the endosperm which nourishes the embryonic plant during germination of various grassrelated grains It is found in wheat barley rye oat related species and hybrids such as spelt khorasan emmer einkorn triticale kamut etc and products of these such as malt Gluten is appreciated for its viscoelastic properties It gives elasticity to dough helping it rise and keep its shape and often gives the final product a chewy texture Wheat prolamins are called gliadins barley prolamins are hordeins rye prolamins are secalins and oats prolamins are avenins which are collectively named gluten Wheat glutelins are called glutenin In a small part of the general population gluten can trigger coeliac disease noncoeliac gluten sensitivity gluten ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis The occurrence of oat avenin toxicity in people with glutenrelated disorders depends on the oat cultivar consumed because the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins are different among oat varieties Also many oat products are crosscontaminated with other glutencontaining cereals True gluten is limited to the grains listed above The stored proteins of maize and rice are sometimes called glutens but their proteins differ from true gluten     Preparation Gluten is a protein complex that accounts for 75 to 85 of the total protein in bread wheat Gluten is prepared from flour by kneading the flour under water agglomerating the gluten into an elastic network a dough and then washing out the starch Starch granules disperse in coldlowtemperature water and the dispersed starch is sedimented and dried If a saline solution is used instead of water a purer protein is obtained with certain harmless impurities departing to the solution with the starch Where starch is the prime product cold water is the favored solvent because the impurities depart from the gluten In home or restaurant cooking a ball of wheat flour dough is kneaded under water until the starch disperses out In industrial production a slurry of wheat flour is kneaded vigorously by machinery until the gluten agglomerates into a mass This mass is collected by centrifugation then transported through several stages integrated in a continuous process About 65 of the water in the wet gluten is removed by means of a screw press the remainder is sprayed through an atomizer nozzle into a drying chamber where it remains at an elevated temperature a short time to evaporate the water without denaturing the gluten The process yields a flourlike powder with a 7 moisture content which is air cooled and pneumatically transported to a receiving vessel In the final step the processed gluten is sifted and milled to produce a uniform product Uses  Bread products Gluten forms when glutenin molecules crosslink to form a submicroscopic network attached to gliadin which contributes viscosity thickness and extensibility to the mix If this dough is leavened with yeast fermentation produces carbon dioxide bubbles which trapped by the gluten network cause the dough to rise Baking coagulates the gluten which along with starch stabilizes the shape of the final product Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the staling of bread possibly because it binds water through hydration The formation of gluten affects the texture of the baked goods Glutens attainable elasticity is proportional to its content of glutenins with low molecular weights as this portion contains the preponderance of the sulfur atoms responsible for the crosslinking in the network More refining of the gluten leads to chewier products such as pizza and bagels while less refining yields tender baked goods such as pastry products Generally bread flours are high in gluten hard wheat pastry flours have a lower gluten content Kneading promotes the formation of gluten strands and crosslinks creating baked products that are chewier in contrast to crumbly The chewiness increases as the dough is kneaded for longer times An increased moisture content in the dough enhances gluten development and very wet doughs left to rise for a long time require no kneading see noknead bread Shortening inhibits formation of crosslinks and is used along with diminished water and less kneading when a tender and flaky product such as a pie crust is desired The strength and elasticity of gluten in flour is measured in the baking industry using a farinograph This gives the baker a measurement of quality for different varieties of flours in developing recipes for various baked goods Added gluten According to Understanding Baking gluten when dried milled and added to ordinary flour dough could help improve the doughs ability to increase in volume The resulted mixture also increases the breads structural stability and chewiness  Glutenadded dough must be worked vigorously to induce it to rise to its full capacity an automatic bread machine or food processor may be required for highgluten kneading Generally higher gluten levels are associated with higher amounts of overall protein Imitation meats   Gluten especially wheat gluten is often the basis for imitation meats resembling beef chicken duck see mock duck fish and pork When cooked in broth gluten absorbs some of the surrounding liquid including the flavor and becomes firm to the bite Other consumer products Gluten is often present in beer and soy sauce and can be used as a stabilizing agent in more unexpected food products such as ice cream and ketchup Foods of this kind may raise a problem for a small number of consumers because the hidden gluten constitutes a hazard for people with celiac disease Gluten is also used in cosmetics hair products and other dermatological preparations Animal feed The protein content of some pet foods may also be enhanced by adding gluten Adverse reactions  Glutenrelated disorders is the umbrella term for all diseases triggered by gluten which include celiac disease CD nonceliac gluten sensitivity NCGS wheat allergy gluten ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis DH Currently their incidence is increasing in most geographic areas of the world It can be explained possibly by the growing westernization of diet increasing use of wheatbased foods included in the Mediterranean diet the progressive replacement of rice by wheat in many countries in Asia the Middle East and North Africa the development in recent years of new types of wheat with a higher amount of cytotoxic gluten peptides and the higher content of gluten in bread and bakery products due to the reduction of dough fermentation time Celiac disease  Celiac disease CD is a long term autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the small intestine caused by the ingestion of wheat barley rye and derivatives that appears in genetically predisposed people of all ages CD is not only a gastrointestinal disease because it may involve several organs and cause an extensive variety of nongastrointestinal symptoms and most importantly it may often be completely asymptomatic Added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers antitissue transglutaminase TG2 are not always present and many people may have minor mucosal lesions without atrophy of the intestinal villi CD affects approximately 1‚Äì2 of the general population but most cases remain unrecognized undiagnosed and untreated and at risk for serious longterm health complications People may suffer severe disease symptoms and be subjected to extensive investigations for many years before a proper diagnosis is achieved Untreated CD may cause malabsorption reduced quality of life iron deficiency osteoporosis an increased risk of intestinal lymphomas and greater mortality CD is associated with some other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1 thyroiditis gluten ataxia psoriasis vitiligo autoimmune hepatitis dermatitis herpetiformis primary sclerosing cholangitis and more CD with classic symptoms which include gastrointestinal manifestations such as chronic diarrhea and abdominal distention malabsorption loss of appetite and impaired growth is currently the least common presentation form of the disease and affects predominantly small children generally younger than two years of age CD with nonclassic symptoms is the most common clinical type and occurs in older children over 2 years old adolescents and adults It is characterized by milder or even absent gastrointestinal symptoms and a wide spectrum of nonintestinal manifestations that can involve any organ of the body and very frequently may be completely asymptomatic both in children at least in 43 of the cases and adults Nonceliac gluten sensitivity  Nonceliac gluten sensitivity NCGS is described as a condition of multiple symptoms that improves when switching to a glutenfree diet after celiac disease and wheat allergy are excluded Recognized since 2010 it is included among glutenrelated disorders but its pathogenesis is not yet well understood NCGS is the most common syndrome of gluten intolerance with a prevalence estimated to be 610 People with NCGS remain habitually in a no mans land without being recognized by the specialists and lacking the adequate medical care and treatment Most of these people have a long history of health complaints and unsuccessful consultations with numerous physicians and this is the reason why the majority of them end up resorting to a glutenfree diet and a selfdiagnosis of gluten sensitivity People with NCGS may develop gastrointestinal symptoms which resemble those of irritable bowel syndrome or wheat allergy or a wide variety of nongastrointestinal symptoms such as headache chronic fatigue fibromyalgia atopic diseases allergies neurological diseases or psychiatric disorders among others Besides gluten additional components present in wheat rye barley and their derivatives including other proteins and shortchain carbohydrates called FODMAPs may cause NCGS symptoms The effects of FODMAPs are only limited to gastrointestinal discomfort Wheat allergy  People can also experience adverse effects of wheat as result of a wheat allergy As with most allergies a wheat allergy causes the immune system to abnormally respond to a component of wheat that it treats as a threatening foreign body This immune response is often timelimited and does not cause lasting harm to body tissues Wheat allergy and celiac disease are different disorders Gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy are similar to those of celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms An allergic reaction to wheat has a fast onset from minutes to hours after the consumption of food containing wheat and could include anaphylaxis Gluten ataxia  Gluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten With gluten ataxia damage takes place in the cerebellum the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking speaking and swallowing with loss of Purkinje cells People with gluten ataxia usually present gait abnormality or incoordination and tremor of the upper limbs Gazeevoked nystagmus and other ocular signs of cerebellar dysfunction are common Myoclonus palatal tremor and opsoclonusmyoclonus may also appear Early diagnosis and treatment with a glutenfree diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible Gluten ataxia accounts for 40 of ataxias of unknown origin and 15 of all ataxias Less than 10 of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom yet about 40 have intestinal damage Labelling International standards The Codex Alimentarius international standards for food labelling has a standard relating to the labelling of products as glutenfree It only applies to foods that would normally contain gluten Brazil By law in Brazil all food products must display labels clearly indicating whether or not they contain gluten Canada The Canadian Celiac Association estimates that one in 133 Canadians experiences adverse symptoms from gluten in celiac disease Labels for all food products sold in Canada must clearly identify the presence of gluten if it is present at a level greater than 20 parts per million United Kingdom In the United Kingdom all prepackaged foods and nonprepacked foods from a restaurant takeout food wrapped just before sale or unpackaged food served in institutions must be identified if glutenfree Glutenfree is defined as 20 parts per million of gluten or less and very low gluten is 100 parts per million of gluten or less only foods with cereal ingredients processed to remove gluten can claim very low gluten on labels United States In the United States gluten is not listed on labels unless added as a standalone ingredient Wheat or other allergens are listed after the ingredient line The US Food and Drug Administration FDA has historically classified gluten as generally recognized as safe GRAS In August 2013 FDA issued a final rule effective August 2014 that defined the term glutenfree for voluntary use in the labeling of foods as meaning that the amount of gluten contained in the food is below 20 parts per million See also Glutenfree diet Gliadin References  Further reading Curtis BC Rajaram S Macpherson HG Bread Wheat Improvement and production ‚Äî FAO Plant Production and

       "  'raw page text': 'The glycemic index or glycaemic index GI  is a number associated with the carbohydrates in a particular type of food that indicates the effect of these carbohydrates on a persons blood glucose also called blood sugar level A value of 100 represents the standard an equivalent amount of pure glucose The GI represents the rise in a persons blood sugar level two hours after consumption of the food The glycemic effects of foods depends on a number of factors such as the type of carbohydrate physical entrapment of the carbohydrate molecules within the food fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal The GI is useful for understanding how the body breaks down carbohydrates and takes into account only the available carbohydrate total carbohydrate minus fiber in a food Glycemic index does not predict an individuals glycemic response to a food but can be used as a tool to assess the insulin response burden of a food averaged across a studied population Individual responses vary greatly The glycemic index is usually applied in the context of the quantity of the food and the amount of carbohydrate in the food that is actually consumed A related measure the glycemic load GL factors this in by multiplying the glycemic index of the food in question by the carbohydrate content of the actual serving Watermelon has a high glycemic index but a low glycemic load for the quantity typically consumed Fructose by contrast has a low glycemic index but can have a high glycemic load if a large quantity is consumed GI tables are available that list many types of foods and their GIs Some tables also include the serving size and the glycemic load of the food per serving  A practical limitation of the glycemic index is that it does not measure insulin production due to rises in blood sugar As a result two foods could have the same glycemic index but produce different amounts of insulin Likewise two foods could have the same glycemic load but cause different insulin responses Furthermore both the glycemic index and glycemic load measurements are defined by the carbohydrate content of food For example when eating steak which has no carbohydrate content but provides a high protein intake up to 50 of that protein can be converted to glucose when there is little to no carbohydrate consumed with it But because it contains no carbohydrate itself steak cannot have a glycemic index For some food comparisons the insulin index may be more useful    Accuracy Glycemic index charts often give only one value per food but variations are possible due to ripeness riper fruits contain more sugars increasing GI cooking methods the more cooked or over cooked a food the more its cellular structure is broken with a tendency for it to digest quickly and raise GI more processing eg flour has a higher GI than the whole grain from which it is ground as grinding breaks the grains protective layers and the length of storage Potatoes are a notable example ranging from moderate to very high GI even within the same variety More importantly the glycemic response is different from one person to another and also in the same person from day to day depending on blood glucose levels insulin resistance and other factors  The glycemic index only indicates the impact on glucose level two hours after eating the food People with diabetes have elevated levels for four hours or longer after eating certain foods Determining the GI of a food Foods with carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion and release glucose rapidly into the bloodstream tend to have a high GI foods with carbohydrates that break down more slowly releasing glucose more gradually into the bloodstream tend to have a low GI The concept was developed by Dr David J Jenkins and colleagues in 1980‚Äì1981 at the University of Toronto in their research to find out which foods were best for people with diabetes A lower glycemic index suggests slower rates of digestion and absorption of the foods carbohydrates and can also indicate greater extraction from the liver and periphery of the products of carbohydrate digestion A lower glycemic response usually equates to a lower insulin demand but not always and can improve longterm blood glucose control and blood lipids The insulin index is also useful for providing a direct measure of the insulin response to a food The glycemic index of a food is defined as the incremental area under the twohour blood glucose response curve AUC following a 12hour fast and ingestion of a food with a certain quantity of available carbohydrate usually 50 g The AUC of the test food is divided by the AUC of the standard either glucose or white bread giving two different definitions and multiplied by 100 The average GI value is calculated from data collected in 10 human subjects Both the standard and test food must contain an equal amount of available carbohydrate The result gives a relative ranking for each tested food The current validated methods use glucose as the reference food giving it a glycemic index value of 100 by definition This has the advantages of being universal and producing maximum GI values of approximately 100 White bread can also be used as a reference food giving a different set of GI values if white bread  100 then glucose ‚âà 140 For people whose staple carbohydrate source is white bread this has the advantage of conveying directly whether replacement of the dietary staple with a different food would result in faster or slower blood glucose response A disadvantage with this system is that the reference food is not welldefined because there is no universal standard for the carbohydrate content of white bread Classification GI values can be interpreted intuitively as percentages on an absolute scale and are commonly interpreted as follows A lowGI food will release glucose more slowly and steadily which leads to more suitable postprandial after meal blood glucose readings A highGI food causes a more rapid rise in blood glucose level and is suitable for energy recovery after exercise or for a person experiencing hypoglycemia The glycemic effect of foods depends on a number of factors such as the type of starch amylose versus amylopectin physical entrapment of the starch molecules within the food fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal ‚Äî adding vinegar for example will lower the GI The presence of fat or soluble dietary fiber can slow the gastric emptying rate thus lowering the GI In general coarse grainy breads with higher amounts of fiber have a lower GI value than white breads However most breads made with 100 whole wheat or wholemeal flour have a GI not very different from endosperm only white bread Many brown breads are treated with enzymes to soften the crust which makes the starch more accessible high GI While adding fat or protein will lower the glycemic response to a meal the relative differences remain That is with or without additions there is still a higher blood glucose curve after a highGI bread than after a lowGI bread such as pumpernickel Fruits and vegetables tend to have a low glycemic index The glycemic index can be applied only to foods where the test relies on subjects consuming an amount of food containing 50 g of available carbohydrate But many fruits and vegetables not potatoes sweet potatoes corn contain less than 50 g of available carbohydrate per typical serving Carrots were originally and incorrectly reported as having a high GI Alcoholic beverages have been reported to have low GI values however beer was initially reported to have a moderate GI due to the presence of maltose This has been refuted by brewing industry professionals who say that all maltose sugar is consumed in the brewing process and that packaged beer has little to no maltose present Recent studies have shown that the consumption of an alcoholic drink prior to a meal reduces the GI of the meal by approximately 15 Moderate alcohol consumption more than 12 hours prior to a test does not affect the GI Many modern diets rely on the glycemic index including the South Beach Diet Transitions by Market America and NutriSystem Nourish Diet However others have pointed out that foods generally considered to be unhealthy can have a low glycemic index for instance chocolate cake GI 38 ice cream 37 or pure fructose 19 whereas foods like potatoes and rice have GIs around 100 but are commonly eaten in some countries with low rates of diabetes Weight control Dietary replacement of saturated fats by carbohydrates with a low glycemic index may be beneficial for weight control whereas substitution with refined high glycemic index carbohydrates is not A Cochrane review found that adoption of low glycemic index or load diets by people who are overweight or obese leads to more weight loss and better fat control than use of diets involving higher glycemic indexload or other strategies Benefits were apparent even with low glycemic indexload diets that allow people to eat as much as they like The authors of the review concluded that Lowering the glycaemic load of the diet appears to be an effective method of promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles and can be simply incorporated into a persons lifestyle In clinical management of obesity diets based on a low glycemic indexload appear to provide better glycemic and inflammatory control than ones based on a high glycemic indexload and therefore could potentially be more effective in preventing obesityrelated diseases In overweight and obese children adoption of low glycemic indexload diets may not lead to weight loss but might potentially provide other benefits Disease prevention Several lines of recent 1999 scientific evidence have shown that individuals who followed a lowGI diet over many years were at a significantly lower risk for developing both type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease and agerelated macular degeneration than others High blood glucose levels or repeated glycemic spikes following a meal can promote these diseases by increasing systemic glycative stress other oxidative stress to the vasculature and also by the direct increase in insulin level The glycative stress sets up a vicious cycle of systemic protein glycation compromised protein editing capacity involving the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway and autophagic pathways leading to enhanced accumulation of glycated and other obsolete proteins Postprandial hyperglycemia is a risk factor associated with diabetes A 1998 study shows that it also presents an increased risk for atherosclerosis in the nondiabetic population and that high GI diets high bloodsugar levels more generally and diabetes are related to kidney disease as well Conversely there are areas such as Peru and Asia where people eat highglycemic index foods such as potatoes and highGI rice without a high level of obesity or diabetes The high consumption of legumes in South America and fresh fruit and vegetables in Asia likely lowers the glycemic effect in these individuals The mixing of high and lowGI carbohydrates produces moderate GI values A study from the University of Sydney in Australia suggests that having a breakfast of white bread and sugarrich cereals over time can make a person susceptible to diabetes heart disease and even cancer A study published in 2007 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that agerelated adult macular degeneration AMD which leads to blindness is 42 higher among people with a highGI diet and concluded that eating a lowerGI diet would eliminate 20 of AMD cases The American Diabetes Association supports glycemic index but warns that the total amount of carbohydrate in the food is still the strongest and most important indicator and that everyone should make their own custom method that works best for them The International Life Sciences Institute concluded in 2011 that because there are many different ways of lowering glycemic response not all of which have the same effects on health It is becoming evident that modifying the glycemic response of the diet should not be seen as a standalone strategy but rather as an element of an overall balanced diet and lifestyle A systematic review of few human trials examined the potential of low GI diet to improve pregnancy outcomes Potential benefits were still seen despite no ground breaking findings in maternal glycemia or pregnancy outcomes In this regard more women under low GI diet achieved the target treatment goal for the postprandial glycemic level and reduced their need for insulin treatment A low GI diet can also provide greater benefits to overweight and obese women Interestingly intervention at an early stage of pregnancy has shown a tendency to lower birth weight and birth centile in infants born to women with GDM Other factors Depending on quantities the number of grams of carbohydrate in a food can have a bigger impact on blood sugar levels than the glycemic index does Consuming less dietary energy losing weight and carbohydrate counting can be better for lowering the blood sugar level Carbohydrates impact glucose levels most profoundly and two foods with the same carbohydrate content are in general comparable in their effects on blood sugar A food with a low glycemic index can have a high carbohydrate content or vice versa this can be accounted for with the glycemic load GL where GL GI x grams of carbohydrate per serving Louie JCY et al 2015 Consuming carbohydrates with a low glycemic index and calculating carbohydrate intake would produce the most stable blood sugar levels Criticism and alternatives While the glycemic index of foods is used as a guide to the rise in blood glucose that should follow meals containing those foods actual increases in blood glucose show considerable variability from person to person even after consumption of identical meals This is in part because glycemic index does not take into account other factors besides glycemic response such as insulin response which is measured by the insulin index and can be more appropriate in representing the effects from some food contents other than carbohydrates In particular since it is based on the area under the curve of the glucose response over time from ingesting a subject food the shape of the curve has no bearing on the corresponding GI value The glucose response can rise to a high level and fall quickly or rise less high but remain there for a longer time and have the same area under the curve For subjects with type 1 diabetes who do not have an insulin response the rate of appearance of glucose after ingestion represents the absorption of the food itself This glycemic response has been modeled where the model parameters for the food enable prediction of the continuous effect of the food over time on glucose values and not merely the ultimate effect that the GI represents Although the glycemic index provides some insights into the relative diabetic risk within specific food groups it contains many counterintuitive ratings These include suggestions that bread generally has a higher glycemic ranking than sugar and that some potatoes are more glycemic than glucose More significantly studies such as that by Bazzano et al demonstrate a significant beneficial diabetic effect for fruit compared to a substantial detrimental impact for fruit juice despite these having similar low GI ratings From blood glucose curves presented by BrandMiller et al the main distinguishing feature between average fruit and fruit juice blood glucose curves is the maximum slope of the leading edge of 438\\xa0mmol¬∑L‚àí1¬∑h‚àí1 for fruit and 671\\xa0mmol¬∑L‚àí1¬∑h‚àí1 for fruit juice This raises the concept that the rate of increase in blood glucose may be a significant determinant particularly when comparing liquids to solids which release carbohydrates over time and therefore have an inherently greater area under the blood glucose curve See also  References  External

       "  'raw page text': 'The glycemic load GL of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a persons blood glucose level after eating it One unit of glycemic load approximates the effect of consuming one gram of glucose Glycemic load accounts for how much carbohydrate is in the food and how much each gram of carbohydrate in the food raises blood glucose levels Glycemic load is based on the glycemic index GI and is calculated by multiplying the grams of available carbohydrate in the food times the foods GI and then dividing by 100    Description Glycemic load estimates the impact of carbohydrate consumption using the glycemic index while taking into account the amount of carbohydrate that is consumed GL is a GIweighted measure of carbohydrate content For instance watermelon has a high GI but a typical serving of watermelon does not contain much carbohydrate so the glycemic load of eating it is low Whereas glycemic index is defined for each type of food glycemic load can be calculated for any size serving of a food an entire meal or an entire days meals Glycemic load of a serving of food can be calculated as its carbohydrate content measured in grams g multiplied by the foods GI and divided by 100 For example watermelon has a GI of 72 A 100\\xa0g serving of watermelon has 5\\xa0g of available carbohydrates it contains a lot of water making the calculation 5 √ó 7210036 so the GL is 36 A food with a GI of 100 and 10\\xa0g of available carbohydrates has a GL of 10 10 √ó 10010010 while a food with 100\\xa0g of carbohydrate and a GI of just 10 also has a GL of 10 100 √ó 1010010 For one serving of a food a GL greater than 20 is considered high a GL of 11‚Äì19 is considered medium and a GL of 10 or less is considered low Foods that have a low GL in a typical serving size almost always have a low GI Foods with an intermediate or high GL in a typical serving size range from a very low to very high GI One 2007 study has questioned the value of using glycemic load as a basis for weightloss programmes Das et al conducted a study on 36 healthy overweight adults using a randomised test to measure the efficacy of two diets one with a high glycemic load and one with a low GL The study concluded that there is no statistically significant difference between the outcome of the two diets Glycemic load appears to be a significant factor in dietary programs targeting metabolic syndrome insulin resistance and weight loss studies have shown that sustained spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels may lead to increased diabetes risk The Shanghai Womens Health Study concluded that women whose diets had the highest glycemic index were 21 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than women whose diets had the lowest glycemic index Similar findings were reported in the Black Womens Health Study A diet program that manages the glycemic load aims to avoid sustained bloodsugar spikes and can help avoid onset of type 2 diabetes For diabetics glycemic load is a highly recommended tool for managing blood sugar The data on GI and GL listed in this article is from the University of Sydney Human Nutrition Unit GI database The GI was invented in 1981 by Dr Thomas Wolever and Dr David Jenkins at the University of Toronto and is a measure of how quickly a food containing 25 or 50\\xa0grams of carbohydrate raises bloodglucose levels Because some foods typically have a low carbohydrate content Harvard researchers created the GL which takes into account the amount of carbohydrates in a given serving of a food and so provides a more useful measure Liu et al were the first to show that based on their calculation the glycemic load of a specific food‚Äîcalculated as the product of that foods carbohydrate content and its glycemic index value‚Äîhas direct physiologic meaning in that each unit can be interpreted as the equivalent of 1 g carbohydrate from white bread or glucose depending on the reference used in determining the glycemic index It became immediately apparent that such direct physiological quantification of glycemic load would allow patients with diabetes to do ‚Äúglycemic load‚Äù counting as opposed to the conventional ‚Äúcarbohydrate counting‚Äù for monitoring the glycemic effect of foods The concept of glycemic load addresses the concern about rating foods as good or bad solely on the basis of their

       "  'raw page text': 'Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in humans animals fungi and bacteria The polysaccharide structure represents the main storage form of glucose in the body Glycogen functions as one of two forms of longterm energy reserves with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue ie body fat In humans glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle In the liver glycogen can make up from 5‚Äì6 of the organs fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70\\xa0kg can store roughly 100‚Äì120\\xa0grams of glycogen In skeletal muscle Glycogen is found in a low concentration 1‚Äì2 of the muscle mass and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70\\xa0kg can store roughly 400\\xa0grams of glycogen The amount of glycogen stored in the body‚Äîparticularly within the muscles and liver‚Äîmostly depends on physical training basal metabolic rate and eating habits Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells including the kidneys red blood cells white blood cells and glial cells in the brain The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo Approximately 4\\xa0grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times in fasted individuals blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself however the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body particularly the central nervous system The human brain consumes approximately 60 of blood glucose in fasted sedentary individuals Glycogen is the analogue of starch a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants It has a structure similar to amylopectin a component of starch but is more extensively branched and compact than starch Both are white powders in their dry state Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosolcytoplasm in many cell types and plays an important role in the glucose cycle Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides lipids    Structure   Glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 1014 glucose units Glucose units are linked together linearly by Œ±1‚Üí4 glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by Œ±1‚Üí6 glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain Due to the way glycogen is synthesised every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein Glycogen in muscle liver and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 045\\xa0millimoles of potassium per gram of glycogen Functions Liver As a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested blood glucose levels rise and the pancreas secretes insulin Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells hepatocytes Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes including glycogen synthase Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful In this postprandial or fed state the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall insulin secretion is reduced and glycogen synthesis stops When it is needed for energy glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown For the next 8‚Äì12 hours glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel Glucagon another hormone produced by the pancreas in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin In response to insulin levels being below normal when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis the breakdown of glycogen and gluconeogenesis the production of glucose from other sources Muscle Muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally as well As muscle cells lack glucose6phosphatase which is required to pass glucose into the blood the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells This is in contrast to liver cells which on demand readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs History Glycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a ferment in the liver By 1857 he described the isolation of a substance he called la mati√®re glycog√®ne or sugarforming substance Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver A Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen The empirical formula for glycogen of C 6H 10O 5n was established by Kekule in 1858 Metabolism Synthesis  Glycogen synthesis is unlike its breakdown endergonic‚Äîit requires the input of energy Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate UTP which reacts with glucose1phosphate forming UDPglucose in a reaction catalysed by UTP‚Äîglucose1phosphate uridylyltransferase Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDPglucose initially by the protein glycogenin which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen since glycogenin is a homodimer After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDPglucose adding Œ±1‚Üí4bonded glucose The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains Breakdown  Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose1phosphate  In vivo phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose1phosphate is usually greater than 100 Glucose1phosphate is then converted to glucose 6phosphate G6P by phosphoglucomutase A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the Œ±16 branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5carbon sugars In the liver and kidney G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6phosphatase This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway Clinical relevance Disorders of glycogen metabolism The most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes in which because of abnormal amounts of insulin liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism as well In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin liver glycogen levels are high but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia Various inborn errors of metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise  Longdistance athletes such as marathon runners crosscountry skiers and cyclists often experience glycogen depletion where almost all of the athletes glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption This phenomenon is referred to as hitting the wall Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways First during exercise carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose high glycemic index are ingested continuously The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35 of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80 of maximum Second through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens eg fasting lowintensity endurance training the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel sparing carbohydrate use from all sources Third by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores This process is known as carbohydrate loading In general glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion When experiencing glycogen debt athletes often experience extreme fatigue to the point that it is difficult to move As a reference the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4 to 5hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly however the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established See also Chitin Peptidoglycan Triglyceride References  External links Glycogen detection using

food such as chocolate without a corresponding increase in activity increases the risk of obesity Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter a fat removed during chocolate refining then added back in varying proportions during manufacturing Manufacturers may add other fats sugars and powdered milk as well Although considerable research has been conducted to evaluate the potential health benefits of consuming chocolate there are insufficient studies to confirm any effect and no medical or regulatory authority has approved any health claim    Research Acne Overall evidence is insufficient to determine the relationship between chocolate consumption and acne One preliminary study concluded that in males who are prone to acne eating chocolate increases the severity of acne Various studies point not to chocolate but to the high glycemic nature of certain foods like sugar corn syrup and other simple carbohydrates as potential causes of acne along with other possible dietary factors Addiction Food including chocolate is not typically viewed as addictive Some people however may want or crave chocolate leading to a selfdescribed term chocoholic Sex It has been claimed that chocolate is an aphrodisiac but there are no rigorous studies to prove this effect Heart and blood vessels Reviews support a shortterm effect of lowering blood pressure by consuming cocoa products but there is no evidence of longterm cardiovascular health benefit While daily consumption of cocoa flavanols minimum dose of 200\\xa0mg appears to benefit platelet and vascular function there is no good evidence to support an effect on heart attacks or strokes Stimulant Chocolate contains caffeine and theobromine both mild stimulants Weight gain The effect of chocolate on body weight is unclear A concern is that excessive consumption of chocolate may promote high calorie intake and weight gain a risk factor for many diseases including cardiovascular disease As a consequence consuming large quantities of dark chocolate in an attempt to protect against cardiovascular disease is likely to add excessive calories and induce weight gain Lead content Although research suggests that even low levels of lead in the body may be harmful to children it is unlikely that chocolate consumption in small amounts causes lead poisoning Some studies have shown that lead may bind to cocoa shells and contamination may occur during the manufacturing process One study showed the mean lead level in milk chocolate candy bars was 0027\\xa0¬µg lead per gram of candy another study found that some chocolate purchased at US supermarkets contained up to 0965\\xa0 ¬µg per gram close to the international voluntary standard limit for lead in cocoa powder or beans which is 1\\xa0¬µg of lead per gram In 2006 the US FDA lowered by onefifth the amount of lead permissible in candy but compliance is only voluntary Studies concluded that children who are big consumers of chocolates may be at risk of exceeding the daily limit of lead whereas one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20 of the daily lead oral limit Moreover chocolate may not be the only source of lead in their nutrition and chocolate might be a significant source of Cd and Pb ingestion particularly for children Polyphenol and theobromine content Chocolate contains polyphenols especially flavan3ols catechins and flavonoids which are under study for their potential effects in the body The following table shows the content of phenolics flavonoids and theobromine in three different types of chocolate Other animals  In sufficient amounts the theobromine found in chocolate is toxic to animals such as cats dogs horses parrots and small rodents because they are unable to metabolise the chemical effectively If animals are fed chocolate the theobromine may remain in the circulation for up to 20\\xa0hours possibly causing epileptic seizures heart attacks internal bleeding and eventually death Medical treatment performed by a veterinarian involves inducing vomiting within two hours of ingestion and administration of benzodiazepines or barbiturates for seizures antiarrhythmics for heart arrhythmias

but other dark chocolates canine toxicities may be extrapolated based on this figure Given access dogs frequently consume chocolate at toxic levels because they like the taste of chocolate products

       "  'raw page text': 'The health effects of salt are the conditions associated with the consumption of either too much or too little salt Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride NaCl and is used in food for both preservation and flavor Sodium ions are needed in small quantities by most living things as are chloride ions Salt is involved in regulating the water content fluid balance of the body The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC states that excess sodium can increase blood pressure and the risk for a heart disease and stroke in some individuals Therefore health authorities recommend limitations on dietary sodium The United States Department of Health and Human Services recommends that individuals consume no more than 1500‚Äì2300\\xa0mg of sodium 3750‚Äì5750\\xa0mg of salt per day depending on race medical condition and age The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume no more than 5 g of salt per day As an essential nutrient sodium is involved in numerous cellular and organ functions Salt intake that is too low below 3 g per day may also increase risk for cardiovascular disease and early death    Acute effects Hypernatremia a blood sodium level above 145 mEqL causes thirst and due to brain cell shrinkage may cause confusion muscle twitching or spasms With severe elevation seizures and comas may occur Death can be caused by ingestion of large amounts of salt at a time about 1\\xa0g per kg of body weight Deaths have also been caused by use of salt solutions as emetics typically after suspected poisoning Hyponatremia or blood sodium levels below 135 mEqL causes brain cells to swell the symptoms can be subtle and may include altered personality lethargy and confusion In severe cases when blood sodium falls below 115 mEqL stupor muscle twitching or spasms seizures coma and death can result Acute hyponatremia is usually caused by drinking too much water with insufficient salt intake Longterm effects  Although many health organizations and recent reviews state that high consumption of salt increases the risk of several diseases in children and adults the effect of high salt consumption on long term health is controversial Some suggest that the effects of high salt consumption are insignificant Excess sodium consumption can increase blood pressure Most studies suggest a U shaped association between salt intake and health with increased mortality associated with both excessively low and excessively high salt intake Health effects associated with excessive sodium consumption include Stroke and cardiovascular disease High blood pressure Evidence shows an association between salt intakes and blood pressure among different populations and age range in adults Reduced salt intake also results in a small but statistically significant reduction in blood pressure Left ventricular hypertrophy cardiac enlargement Evidence suggests that high salt intake causes left ventricular hypertrophy This is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease independently of blood pressure effects there is accumulating evidence that high salt intake can predicts left ventricular hypertrophy Excessive salt sodium intake combined with an inadequate intake of water can cause hypernatremia It can exacerbate renal disease Edema A decrease in salt intake has been suggested to treat edema fluid retention Stomach cancer is associated with high levels of sodium but the evidence does not generally relate to

established in the United Kingdom in 1996 actively campaigns to raise awareness of the alleged harmful health effects of salt The 2008 focus includes raising awareness of high levels of salt hidden in sweet foods that are marketed towards children In 2004 Britains Food Standards Agency started a public health campaign called Salt ‚Äì Watch it which recommends no more than 6g of salt per day it features a character called Sid the Slug and was criticised by the Salt Manufacturers Association SMA The Advertising Standards Authority did not uphold the SMA complaint in its adjudication In March 2007 the FSA launched the third phase of their campaign with the slogan Salt Is your food full of it fronted by comedian Jenny Eclair The University of Tasmanias Menzies Research Institute maintains a website to educate people about the problems of a saltladen diet In Australia the Drop the Salt Campaign aimed to reduce the consumption of salt by Australians to 6g per day over the course of five years ending in 2012 In January 2010 New York City launched the National Salt Reduction Initiative NSRI It is the only coordinated voluntary effort to reduce sodium in the United States an effort supported by the Institute of Medicine as an interim goal in advance of federal action on sodium reduction As of 2013 over 90 state and local health authorities and health organizations have signed on as partners of the NSRI Together the NSRI partnership encourages food manufacturers and chain restaurants to voluntarily commit to NSRI sodium reduction targets for 2012 and 2014 The NSRI aims to reduce sodium in the food supply by 25 percent in five years and reduce population sodium intake by 20 percent in the same time thereby reducing risk for heart attacks and strokes Twentyone companies met their 2012 NSRI commitment Notable reductions include 15 percent reduction of sodium in Heinz ketchup 32 percent reduction of sodium in the Subway‚Äôs Subway Club sandwich 33 percent reduction of sodium in Nabisco‚Äôs Honey Teddy Grahams 18 percent reduction of sodium in Kraft Single American Slices and 20 percent reduction of Ragu Old World Style Traditional Tomato Sauce Separate from the

high Taking an alternative view the Salt Institute a salt industry body based in North America is active in promoting the use of salt and questioning or opposing the recommended restrictions on salt intake Lowering salt in diet A low sodium diet reduces the intake of sodium by the careful selection of food The use of a salt substitute can provide a taste offsetting the perceived blandness of

detrimental to health and it is advised that potassium chloride not be used by those taking certain prescription drugs The use of seaweed granules in the manufacture of processed foods is being researched as an alternative to salt A 2017 Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled trials reported that lowered dietary salt intake lowered blood pressure in people with hypertension by about 35 indicating that it might be a useful supplementary treatment for hypertension In people with normal blood pressure the decrease after lowering dietary salt intake was less than 1 The effects in Asians and blacks with hypertension were greater than in whites but more studies are needed to confirm conclusions Effects of lowered salt intake on hormones and lipids were similar in normotensive and hypertensive individuals Studies found that excessively low sodium intake below about three grams of salt per day is associated with increased mortality and higher risk for cardiovascular disease

       "  'raw page text': 'According to legend the health effects of tea have been examined ever since the first infusions of Camellia sinensis about 4700 years ago in China Emperor Shennong claimed in The Divine Farmers HerbRoot Classic that Camellia sinensis infusions were useful for treating a variety of disease conditions Historically as well as today in regions without access to safe drinking water the boiling of water to make tea has been effective in reducing waterborne diseases by destroying pathogenic microorganisms Recently concerns have been raised about the traditional method of overboiling tea to produce a decoction which may increase the amount of pesticides and other harmful contaminants released and consumed Black tea has been studied extensively for its potential to lower the risk of human diseases but none of this research is conclusive as of 2015    By constituents or substances Aluminum iron and other metals  Tea drinking accounts for a high proportion of aluminum in the human diet The levels are safe but there has been some concern that aluminum traces may be associated with Alzheimers disease A recent study additionally indicated that some teas contained possibly risky amounts of lead mostly Chinese and aluminum IndianSri Lanka blends China There is still insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions on this subject Most studies have found no association between tea intake and iron absorption However drinking excessive amounts of black tea may inhibit the absorption of iron and may harm people with anaemia Fluoride exposure  All tea leaves contain fluoride however mature leaves contain as much as 10 to 20 times the fluoride levels of young leaves from the same plant The fluoride content of a tea leaf depends on the leaf picking method used and the fluoride content of the soil from which it has been grown tea plants absorb this element at a greater rate than other plants Care in the choice of the location where the plant is grown may reduce the risk It is speculated that handpicked tea would contain less fluoride than machineharvested tea because there is a much lower chance of harvesting older leaves during the harvest process A 2013 British study of 38 teas found that cheaper UK supermarket tea blends had the highest levels of fluoride with about 580\\xa0mg per kilogram green teas averaged about 397\\xa0mg per kg and pure blends about 132\\xa0mg per kg The researchers suggested that economy teas may use older leaves which contain more fluoride They calculated a person drinking a litre of economy tea per day would consume about 4\\xa0mg of fluoride the maximum recommended amount of fluoride per day but below the maximum tolerable amount of 10\\xa0mg fluoride per day Oxalates Tea contains oxalate overconsumption of which can cause kidney stones as well as binding with free calcium in the body The bioavailability of oxalate from tea is low thus a possible negative effect requires a large intake of tea Massive black tea consumption has been linked to kidney failure due to its high oxalate content acute oxalate nephropathy Theanine and caffeine  Tea also contains theanine and the stimulant caffeine at about 3 of its dry weight translating to between 30\\xa0mg and 90\\xa0mg per 8 oz 250 ml cup depending on type brand and brewing method Tea also contains small amounts of theobromine and theophylline Dry tea has more caffeine by weight than dry coffee nevertheless more dry coffee than dry tea is used in typical drink preparations which results in a cup of brewed tea containing significantly less caffeine than a cup of coffee of the same size The caffeine in tea is a mild diuretic However the British Dietetic Association has suggested that tea can be used to supplement normal water consumption and that the style of tea and coffee and the amounts we drink in the UK are unlikely to have a negative effect on hydration By conditions Cancer In 2011 the US Food and Drug Administration FDA reported that there was very little evidence to support the claim that green tea consumption may reduce the risk of breast and prostate cancer The US National Cancer Institute reports that in epidemiological studies and the few clinical trials of tea for the prevention of cancer the results have been inconclusive The institute does not recommend for or against the use of tea to reduce the risk of any type of cancer  Inconsistencies in study findings regarding tea and cancer risk may be due to variability in tea preparation tea consumption the bioavailability of tea compounds the amounts that can be absorbed by the body lifestyle differences and individual genetic differences Though there is some positive evidence for risk reduction of breast prostate ovarian and endometrial cancers with green tea it is weak and inconclusive Metaanalyses of observational studies have concluded that black tea consumption does not appear to protect against the development of oral cancers in Asian or Caucasian populations the development of esophageal cancer or prostate cancer in Asian populations or the development of lung cancer Cardiovascular disease Black tea consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of stroke Green tea and black tea both have a beneficial effect on endothelial function and thus arterial health However the addition of milk to the tea completely blunts the teas arteryrelaxing effects A 2013 Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials RCT greater than 3 months duration concluded that longterm consumption of black tea slightly lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressures about 1‚Äì2 mmHg This conclusion was based on limited evidence Another metaanalysis of RCTs reached a similar conclusion Cognitive decline Tea may have a protective effect against agerelated cognitive impairmentdecline and dementia later in life based on correlations found in epidemiological studies if there is a protective effect it is not dependent on dose and there appears to be a stronger effect for women than men However the association is not found in all cognitive domains investigated Fracture risk Tea consumption does not appear to affect the risk of bone fracture including hip fractures or fractures of the humerus in men or women Hyperlipidemia A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that longterm black tea consumption lowers the blood concentration of LDL cholesterol by 043\\xa0mmolL or 774\\xa0mgdL Weight loss Green tea is commonly believed to be a weight loss aid but there is no good evidence that its consumption has any meaningful benefit in helping overweight or obese people to lose weight or that it helps them to maintain a healthy body weight Use of green tea for attempted weight loss carries some risk in rare

       "  'raw page text': 'The history of USDA nutrition guides includes over 100 years of American nutrition advice The guides have been updated over time to adopt new scientific findings and new public health marketing techniques Over time they have described from 4 to 11 food groups Various guides have been criticized as not accurately representing scientific information about optimal nutrition and as being overly influenced by the agricultural industries the USDA promotes    Earliest guides The USDAs first nutrition guidelines were published in 1894 by Dr Wilbur Olin Atwater as a farmers bulletin In Atwaters 1904 publication titled Principles of Nutrition and Nutritive Value of Food he advocated variety proportionality and moderation measuring calories and an efficient affordable diet that focused on nutrientrich foods and less fat sugar and starch This information preceded the discovery of individual vitamins beginning in 1910 A new guide in 1916 Food for Young Children by nutritionist Caroline Hunt categorized foods into milk and meat cereals vegetables and fruits fats and fatty foods and sugars and sugary foods How to Select Food in 1917 promoted these five food groups to adults and the guidelines remained in place through the 1920s In 1933 the USDA introduced food plans at four different cost levels in response to the Great Depression In 1941 the first Recommended Dietary Allowances were created listing specific intakes for calories protein iron calcium and vitamins A B1 B2 B3 C and D Basic 7  In 1943 during World War II The USDA introduced a nutrition guide promoting the Basic 7 food groups to help maintain nutritional standards under wartime food rationing The Basic 7 food groups were Green and yellow vegetables some raw some cooked frozen or canned Oranges tomatoes grapefruit or raw cabbage or salad greens Potatoes and other vegetables and fruits raw dried cooked frozen or canned Milk and milk products fluid evaporated dried milk or cheese Meat poultry fish or eggs or dried beans peas nuts or peanut butter Bread flour and cereals natural whole grain or enriched or restored Butter and fortified margarine with added Vitamin A Basic Four From 1956 until 1992 the United States Department of Agriculture recommended its Basic Four food groups These food groups were Vegetables and fruits Recommended as excellent sources of vitamins C and A and a good source of fiber Four or more servings from this group were recommended daily Previous USDA food guides showed vegetables and fruits as unique groups each with at least two recommended servings per day Milk Recommended as a good source of calcium phosphorus protein riboflavin and sometimes vitamins A and D Cheese ice cream and ice milk could sometimes replace milk Four servings from this group for teens and two for adults were recommended as a minimum daily Meat Two daily servings at least were recommended for protein iron and certain B vitamins Includes meat poultry fish eggs dry beans dry peas and peanut butter Cereals and breads Whole grain and enriched breads were especially recommended as good sources of iron B vitamins and carbohydrates as well as sources of protein and fiber Includes cereals breads cornmeal macaroni noodles rice and spaghetti With the Basic Four daily food guide the recommended minimum daily servings for the grains group doubled from two to four Previously in the Basic Seven guide refined and nonenriched grains were included along with solid fats and sugar in a cluster of foods outside the essential seven Other foods were said to round out meals and satisfy appetites These included additional servings from the Basic Four or foods such as butter margarine salad dressing and cooking oil sauces jellies and syrups The Basic Four guide was omnipresent in nutrition education in the United States A notable example is the 1972 series Mulligan Stew providing nutrition education for schoolchildren in reruns until 1981 Food Guide Pyramid   The introduction of the USDAs food guide pyramid in 1992 attempted to express the recommended servings of each food group which previous guides did not do 6 to 11 servings of bread cereal rice and pasta occupied the large base of the pyramid followed by 3 to 5 servings of vegetables then fruits 2 to 4 then milk yogurt and cheese 2 to 3 followed by meat poultry fish dry beans eggs and nuts 2 to 3 and finally fats oils and sweets in the small apex to be used sparingly Inside each group were several images of representative foods as well as symbols representing the fat and sugar contents of the foods A modified food pyramid was proposed for adults aged over 70 This Modified Food Pyramid for 70 Adults accounted for changing diets with age by emphasizing water consumption as well as nutrientdense and highfiber foods Controversy The first chart suggested to the USDA by nutritional experts in 1992 featured fruits and vegetables as the biggest group not breads This chart was overturned at the hand of special interests in the grain meat and dairy industries all of which are heavily subsidized by the USDA If Americans followed the chart suggested they would buy much less meat milk and bread On the other hand if they ate as the revised chart suggested it could lead to an epidemic of obesity and diabetes as original composer of the food Pyramid Luise Light warned The Pyramid emphasized eating more vegetables and fruits less meat salt sugary foods bad fat and additiverich factory foods USDA censored that researchbased version of the food guide and altered it to include more refined grains meat commercial snacks and fast foods only releasing their revamped version 12 years after it was originally scheduled for release   MyPyramid   In 2005 the USDA updated its guide with MyPyramid which replaced the hierarchical levels of the Food Guide Pyramid with colorful vertical wedges often displayed without images of foods creating a more abstract design Stairs were added up the left side of the pyramid with an image of a climber to represent a push for exercise The share of the pyramid allotted to grains now only narrowly edged out vegetables and milk which were of equal proportions Fruits were next in size followed by a narrower wedge for protein and a small sliver for oils An unmarked white tip represented discretionary calories for items such as candy alcohol or additional food from any other group MyPlate   MyPlate is the current nutrition guide published by the United States Department of Agriculture consisting of a diagram of a plate and glass divided into five food groups It replaced the USDAs MyPyramid diagram on June 2 2011 ending 19 years of food pyramid iconography The guide will be displayed on food packaging and used in nutritional education in the United States Dietary Guidelines The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in the USDA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services jointly released a longer textual document called Dietary Guidelines for Americans updated in 2010 with the next scheduled revision in 2015 The first edition was published in 1980 and since 1985 has been updated every five years by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Like the USDA Food Pyramid these guidelines have been criticized as being overly influenced by the agriculture industry These criticisms of the Dietary Guidelines arose due to the content the Public Health Service decided to include The phrasing of recommendations was extremely important and widely affected everyone who read it The wording had to be changed constantly as there were protests due to comments such as ‚Äúcut down on fatty meats‚Äù which led to the US Department of Agriculture having to stop the publication of the USDA Food Book Slight alterations of various dietary guidelines had to be made throughout the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to calm down the protests emerged As a compromise the phrase was changed to ‚Äúchoose lean meat‚Äù but didn‚Äôt result in a better situation In 2015 the committee factored in environmental sustainability for the first time in its recommendations The committees 2015 report found that a healthy diet should comprise higher plant based foods and lower animal based foods It also found that a plant food based diet was better for the environment than one based on meat and dairy In 2013 and again in 2015 Edward Archer and colleagues published a series of research articles in PlosOne 1 and Mayo Clinic Proceedings 2 3 demonstrating that the dietary data used to develop the US Dietary Guidelines were physiologically implausible ie incompatible with survival and therefore these data were inadmissible as scientific evidence and should not be used to inform public policy In 2016 Nina Teicholz authored a critique of the US Dietary Guidelines in the British Medical Journal BMJ titled The scientific report guiding the US dietary guidelines is it scientific 4 Teicholz suggested that the scientific committee advising the US government has not used standard methods for most of its analyses and instead relies heavily on systematic reviews from professional bodies such as the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology which are heavily supported by food and drug companies See also List of nutrition guides 5 A Day Fruits amp Veggies

       "  'raw page text': 'Human nutrition refers to the provision of essential nutrients necessary to support human life and health Generally people can survive up to 40 days without food a period largely depending on the amount of water consumed stored body fat muscle mass and genetic factors Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty poor nutrition understanding and practices and deficient sanitation and food security Malnutrition and its consequences are immense contributors to deaths and disabilities worldwide Promoting good nutrition helps children grow promotes human development and eradication of poverty  Overview The human body contains chemical compounds such as water carbohydrates sugar starch and fiber amino acids in proteins fatty acids in lipids and nucleic acids DNA and RNA These compounds consist of elements such as carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus calcium iron zinc magnesium manganese and so on All the chemical compounds and elements contained in the human body occur in various forms and combinations such as hormones vitamins phospholipids and hydroxyapatite These compounds may be found in the human body as well as in the various types of organisms that humans consume Any study done to determine nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all the materials excreted and eliminated from the body including urine and feces Comparing food to waste material can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized by the body The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period of time during which all food and waste must be analyzed The number of variables involved in such experiments is high making nutritional studies timeconsuming and expensive which explains why the science of human nutrition is still slowly evolving Nutrients  The seven major classes of nutrients are carbohydrates fats fiber minerals proteins vitamins and water These nutrient classes are categorized as either macronutrients or micronutrients needed in small quantities The macronutrients are carbohydrates fats fiber proteins and water The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins The macronutrients excluding fiber and water provide structural material amino acids from which proteins are built and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built and energy Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally and in either case it is measured in Joules or kilocalories often called Calories and written with a capital C to distinguish them from little c calories Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17\\xa0kJ approximately 4\\xa0kcal of energy per gram while fats provide 37\\xa0kJ 9\\xa0kcal per gram though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort which vary substantially from instance to instance Vitamins minerals fiber and water do not provide energy but are required for other reasons A third class of dietary material fiber ie nondigestible material such as cellulose seems also to be required for both mechanical and biochemical reasons though the exact reasons remain unclear For all age groups males need to consume higher amounts of macronutrients than females In general intakes increase with age until the second or third decade of life Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides glucose fructose galactose to complex polysaccharides starch Fats are triglycerides made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone Some fatty acids but not all are essential in the diet they cannot be synthesized in the body Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon oxygen and hydrogen The fundamental components of protein are nitrogencontaining amino acids some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally Some of the amino acids are convertible with the expenditure of energy to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose By breaking down existing protein some glucose can be produced internally the remaining amino acids are discarded primarily as urea in urine This occurs naturally when atrophy takes place or during periods of starvation Carbohydrates   Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides disaccharides or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer sugar units they contain They are a diverse group of substances with a range of chemical physical and physiological properties They make up a large part of foods such as rice noodles bread and other grainbased products but they are not an essential nutrient meaning a human does not need to eat carbohydrates Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit disaccharides two and polysaccharides three or more Monosaccharides include glucose fructose and galactose Disaccharides include sucrose lactose and maltose purified sucrose for instance is used as table sugar Polysaccharides which include starch and glycogen are often referred to as complex carbohydrates because they are typically long multiplebranched chains of sugar units The difference is that complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption The spike in blood glucose levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases which have become more common in recent times Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than in the past perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease The degree of causation is still not clear Simple carbohydrates are absorbed quickly and therefore raise bloodsugar levels more rapidly than other nutrients However the most important plant carbohydrate nutrient starch varies in its absorption Gelatinized starch starch heated for a few minutes in the presence of water is far more digestible than plain starch and starch which has been divided into fine particles is also more absorbable during digestion The increased effort and decreased availability reduces the available energy from starchy foods substantially and can be seen experimentally in rats and anecdotally in humans Additionally up to a third of dietary starch may be unavailable due to mechanical or chemical difficulty Fat  A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty acids containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms bonded to a glycerol They are typically found as triglycerides three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms doublebonded so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated one doublebond or polyunsaturated many doublebonds Furthermore depending on the location of the doublebond in the fatty acid chain unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega3 or omega6 fatty acids Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with transisomer bonds these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources they are typically created in an industrial process called partial hydrogenation Many studies have shown that consumption of unsaturated fats particularly monounsaturated fats is associated with better health in humans Saturated fats typically from animal sources are next in order of preference while trans fats are associated with a variety of disease and should be avoided Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature such as butter or lard while unsaturated fats are typically liquids such as olive oil or flaxseed oil Trans fats are very rare in nature but have properties useful in the food processing industry such as rancidity resistance Most fatty acids are not essential meaning the body can produce them as needed generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so However in humans at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids ‚Äì omega3 and omega6 fatty acids ‚Äì seems also important for health though definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive Both of these omega longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins which have roles throughout the human body They are hormones in some respects The omega3 eicosapentaenoic acid EPA which can be made in the human body from the omega3 essential fatty acid alphalinolenic acid LNA or taken in through marine food sources serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins eg weakly inflammatory PGE3 The omega6 dihomogammalinolenic acid DGLA serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins eg antiinflammatory PGE1 whereas arachidonic acid AA serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins eg proinflammatory PGE 2 Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega6 linoleic acid LA in the human body or can be taken in directly through food An appropriately balanced intake of omega3 and omega6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins one reason a balance between omega3 and omega6 is believed important for cardiovascular health In industrialized societies people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega6 fatty acids relative to omega3 fatty acids Fiber  Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate specifically a polysaccharide which is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals Like all carbohydrates when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories kilocalories of energy per gram but in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility The two subcategories are insoluble and soluble fiber Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans because humans do not have the required enzymes to break it down and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of microbes that can do so Soluble dietary fiber comprises a variety of oligosaccharides waxes esters resistant starches and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce shortchain fatty acids which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric content Whole grains beans and other legumes fruits especially plums prunes and figs and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber Fiber is important to digestive health and is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer For mechanical reasons fiber can help in alleviating both constipation and diarrhea Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents and insoluble fiber especially stimulates peristalsis ‚Äì the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high viscosity this is essentially a gel which slows the movement of food through the intestines Additionally fiber perhaps especially that from whole grains may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes Protein  Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures eg muscles skin and hair and form the enzymes which catalyse chemical reactions throughout the body Each protein molecule is composed of amino acids which contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein such as the keratin in hair The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins protein retention and to replace damaged proteins maintenance Amino acids are soluble in the digestive juices within the small intestine where they are absorbed into the blood Once absorbed they cannot be stored in the body so they are either metabolized as required or excreted in the urine Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition Amino acids which an animal cannot synthesize on its own from smaller molecules are deemed essential The synthesis of some amino acids can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress and those are called conditionally essential A vegetarian diet can adequately supply protein support pregnancy childhood and athletic endeavors and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer Minerals  Dietary minerals are the chemical elements required by living organisms other than the four elements carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules The term mineral is archaic since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet Some are heavier than the four just mentioned ‚Äì including several metals which often occur as ions in the body Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally or at least as complex compounds or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources On the other hand minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements the most famous is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter Essential dietary minerals include the following Chlorine as chloride ions very common electrolyte see sodium below Magnesium required for processing ATP and related reactions builds bone causes strong peristalsis increases flexibility increases alkalinity Approximately 50 is in bone the remaining 50 is almost all inside body cells with only about 1 located in extracellular fluid Food sources include oats buckwheat tofu nuts caviar green leafy vegetables legumes and chocolate Phosphorus required component of bones essential for energy processing Approximately 80 is found in inorganic portion of bones and teeth Phosphorus is a component of every cell as well as important metabolites including DNA RNA ATP and phospholipids Also important in pH regulation Food sources include cheese egg yolk milk meat fish poultry wholegrain cereals and many others Potassium a very common electrolyte heart and nerve health With sodium potassium is involved in maintaining normal water balance osmotic equilibrium and acidbase balance In addition to calcium it is important in the regulation of neuromuscular activity Food sources include bananas avocados vegetables potatoes legumes fish and mushrooms Sodium a very common electrolyte not generally found in dietary supplements despite being needed in large quantities because the ion is very common in food typically as sodium chloride or common salt Trace minerals Many elements are required in smaller amounts microgram quantities usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes Some trace mineral elements RDA lt 200\\xa0mgday are in alphabetical order Cobalt required for biosynthesis of vitamin B12 family of coenzymes Copper required component of many redox enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase Chromium required for sugar metabolism Iodine required not only for the biosynthesis of thyroxin but probably for other important organs as breast stomach salivary glands thymus etc see Iodine deficiency for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list and sometimes classified with the macrominerals It can be found in ionized salt Iron required for many enzymes and for hemoglobin and some other proteins Manganese processing of oxygen Molybdenum required for xanthine oxidase and related oxidases Selenium required for peroxidase antioxidant proteins Zinc required for several enzymes such as carboxypeptidase liver alcohol dehydrogenase carbonic anhydrase Vitamins  As with the minerals discussed above some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients necessary in the diet for good health Vitamin D is the exception it can alternatively be synthesized in the skin in the presence of UVB radiation Certain vitaminlike compounds that are recommended in the diet such as carnitine are thought useful for survival and health but these are not essential dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds Moreover thousands of different phytochemicals have recently been discovered in food particularly in fresh vegetables which may have desirable properties including antioxidant activity see below experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include essential amino acids see above essential fatty acids see above and the minerals discussed in the preceding section Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions goiter scurvy osteoporosis impaired immune system disorders of cell metabolism certain forms of cancer symptoms of premature aging and poor psychological health including eating disorders among many others Malnutrition  Malnutrition refers to insufficient excessive or imbalanced consumption of nutrients In developed countries the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption Although there are more people in the world who are malnourished due to excessive consumption according to the United Nations World Health Organization the greatest challenge in developing nations today is not starvation but insufficient nutrition ‚Äì the lack of nutrients necessary for the growth and maintenance of vital functions The causes of malnutrition are directly linked to inadequate macronutrient consumption and disease and are indirectly linked to factors like ‚Äúhousehold food security maternal and child care health services and the environment‚Äù  Illnesses Mental agility  Research indicates that improving the awareness of nutritious meal choices and establishing longterm habits of healthy eating has a positive effect on a cognitive and spatial memory capacity potentially increasing a students potential to process and retain academic information Some organizations have begun working with teachers policymakers and managed foodservice contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university level institutions Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success Currently less than 10 of American college students report that they eat the recommended five servings of fruit and vegetables daily Better nutrition has been shown to affect both cognitive and spatial memory performance a study showed those with higher blood sugar levels performed better on certain memory tests In another study those who consumed yogurt performed better on thinking tasks when compared to those who consumed caffeine free diet soda or confections Nutritional deficiencies have been shown to have a negative effect on learning behavior in mice as far back as 1951Better learning performance is associated with diet induced effects on learning and memory ability The nutritionlearning nexus demonstrates the correlation between diet and learning and has application in a higher education setting We find that better nourished children perform significantly better in school partly because they enter school earlier and thus have more time to learn but mostly because of greater learning productivity per year of schooling 91 of college students feel that they are in good health while only 7 eat their recommended daily allowance of fruits and vegetables Nutritional education is an effective and workable model in a higher education setting More engaged learning models that encompass nutrition is an idea that is picking up steam at all levels of the learning cycle Mental disorders Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder the four most common mental disorders in developed countries It is because Lakhan and Vieira mentioned that the supplements possess amino acids that may change into neurotransmitters and improve mental disorders Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid each of which are an omega3 fatty acid contained in fish oil but not in flaxseed oil vitamin B12 folic acid and inositol Cancer Cancer has become common in developing countries According to a study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer In the developing world cancers of the liver stomach and esophagus were more common often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods such as smoked or salted food and parasitic infections that attack organs Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco Developed countries tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a Western lifestyle ‚Äì cancers of the colon rectum breast and prostate ‚Äì that can be caused by obesity lack of exercise diet and age A comprehensive worldwide report Food Nutrition Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer a Global Perspective compiled by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research reports that there is a significant relation between lifestyle including food consumption and cancer prevention The same report recommends eating mostly foods of plant origin and aiming to meet nutritional needs through diet alone while limiting consumption of energydense foods red meat alcoholic drinks and salt and avoiding sugary drinks processed meat and moldy cereals grains or pulses legumes Protein consumption leads to an increase in IGF1 which plays a role in cancer development Metabolic syndrome and obesity Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyleinduced hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin function ie insulin resistance as decisive factors in many disease states For example hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and clot formation ie heart disease and exaggerated cell division ie cancer Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance the socalled metabolic syndrome are characterized by a combination of abdominal obesity elevated blood sugar elevated blood pressure elevated blood triglycerides and reduced HDL cholesterol Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone leptin and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulinleptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulinleptin stimulation and fat storage as a result of high intake of strongly insulinleptin stimulating foods and energy Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the hypothalamus in the brain however insulinleptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors ‚Äì such as intake of processed carbohydrates total protein fat and carbohydrate intake intake of saturated and trans fatty acids and low intake of vitaminsminerals ‚Äì contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance Evidence indicates that diets possibly protective against metabolic syndrome include low saturated and trans fat intake and foods rich in dietary fiber such as high consumption of fruits and vegetables and moderate intake of lowfat dairy products Global nutrition challenges The challenges facing global nutrition are disease child malnutrition obesity and vitamin deficiency Disease The most common noninfectious diseases worldwide that contribute most to the global mortality rate are cardiovascular diseases various cancers diabetes and chronic respiratory problems all of which are linked to poor nutrition Nutrition and diet are closely associated with the leading causes of death including cardiovascular disease and cancer Obesity and high sodium intake can contribute to ischemic heart disease while consumption of fruits and vegetables can decrease the risk of developing cancer Foodborne and infectious diseases can result in malnutrition and malnutrition exacerbates infectious disease Poor nutrition leaves children and adults more susceptible to contracting lifethreatening diseases such as diarrheal infections and respiratory infections According to the WHO in 2011 69 million children died of infectious diseases like pneumonia diarrhea malaria and neonatal conditions of which at least one third were associated with undernutrition Child malnutrition  According to UNICEF in 2011 101 million children across the globe were underweight and one in four children 165 million were stunted in growth Simultaneously there are 43 million children under five who are overweight or obese Nearly 20 million children under 5 suffer from severe acute malnutrition a lifethreatening condition requiring urgent treatment According to estimations at UNICEF hunger will be responsible for 56 million deaths of children under the age of five this year These all represent significant public health emergencies This is because proper maternal and child nutrition has immense consequences for survival acute and chronic disease incidence normal growth and economic productivity of individuals Childhood malnutrition is common and contributes to the global burden of disease Childhood is a particularly important time to achieve good nutrition status because poor nutrition has the capability to lock a child in a vicious cycle of disease susceptibility and recurring sickness which threatens cognitive and social development Undernutrition and bias in access to food and health services leaves children less likely to attend or perform well in school Undernutrition  UNICEF defines undernutrition ‚Äúas the outcome of insufficient food intake hunger and repeated infectious diseases Under nutrition includes being underweight for one‚Äôs age too short for one‚Äôs age stunted dangerously thin wasted and deficient in vitamins and minerals micronutrient malnutrient Under nutrition causes 53 of deaths of children under five across the world It has been estimated that undernutrition is the underlying cause for 35 of child deaths The Maternal and Child Nutrition Study Group estimate that under nutrition ‚Äúincluding fetal growth restriction stunting wasting deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding is a cause of 31 million child deaths and infant mortality or 45 of all child deaths in 2011‚Äù When humans are undernourished they no longer maintain normal bodily functions such as growth resistance to infection or have satisfactory performance in school or work Major causes of under nutrition in young children include lack of proper breast feeding for infants and illnesses such as diarrhea pneumonia malaria and HIVAIDS According to UNICEF 146 million children across the globe that one out of four under the age of five are underweight The amount of underweight children has decreased since 1990 from 33 percent to 28 percent between 1990 and 2004 Underweight and stunted children are more susceptible to infection more likely to fall behind in school more likely to become overweight and develop noninfectious diseases and ultimately earn less than their nonstunted coworkers Therefore undernutrition can accumulate deficiencies in health which results in less productive individuals and societies  Many children are born with the inherent disadvantage of low birth weight often caused by intrauterine growth restriction and poor maternal nutrition which results in worse growth development and health throughout the course of their lifetime Children born at low birthweight less than 55 pounds or 25\\xa0kg are less likely to be healthy and are more susceptible to disease and early death Those born at low birthweight also are likely to have a depressed immune system which can increase their chances of heart disease and diabetes later on in life Because 96 of low birthweight occurs in the developing world low birthweight is associated with being born to a mother in poverty with poor nutritional status that has had to perform demanding labor Stunting and other forms of undernutrition reduces a child‚Äôs chance of survival and hinders their optimal growth and health Stunting has demonstrated association with poor brain development which reduces cognitive ability academic performance and eventually earning potential Important determinants of stunting include the quality and frequency of infant and child feeding infectious disease susceptibility and the mother‚Äôs nutrition and health status Undernourished mothers are more likely to birth stunted children perpetuating a cycle of undernutrition and poverty Stunted children are more likely to develop obesity and chronic diseases upon reaching adulthood Therefore malnutrition resulting in stunting can further worsen the obesity epidemic especially in low and middle income countries This creates even new economic and social challenges for vulnerable impoverished groups Data on global and regional food supply shows that consumption rose from 20112012 in all regions Diets became more diverse with a decrease in consumption of cereals and roots and an increase in fruits vegetables and meat products However this increase masks the discrepancies between nations where Africa in particular saw a decrease in food consumption over the same years This information is derived from food balance sheets that reflect national food supplies however this does not necessarily reflect the distribution of micro and macronutrients Often inequality in food access leaves distribution which uneven resulting in undernourishment for some and obesity for others Undernourishment or hunger according to the FAO is dietary intake below the minimum daily energy requirement The amount of undernourishment is calculated utilizing the average amount of food available for consumption the size of the population the relative disparities in access to the food and the minimum calories required for each individual According to FAO 868 million people 12 of the global population were undernourished in 2012 This has decreased across the world since 1990 in all regions except for Africa where undernourishment has steadily increased However the rates of decrease are not sufficient to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger between 1990 and 2015 The global financial economic and food price crisis in 2008 drove many people to hunger especially women and children The spike in food prices prevented many people from escaping poverty because the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food and farmers are net consumers of food High food prices cause consumers to have less purchasing power and to substitute morenutritious foods with lowcost alternatives Adult overweight and obesity  Malnutrition in industrialized nations is primarily due to excess calories and nonnutritious carbohydrates which has contributed to the obesity epidemic affecting both developed and some developing nations In 2008 35 of adults above the age of 20 years were overweight BMI 25\\xa0kgm a prevalence that has doubled worldwide between 1980 and 2008 Also 10 of men and 14 of women were obese with an BMI greater than 30 Rates of overweight and obesity vary across the globe with the highest prevalence in the Americas followed by European nations where over 50 of the population is overweight or obese Obesity is more prevalent amongst high income and higher middle income groups than lower divisions of income Women are more likely than men to be obese where the rate of obesity in women doubled from 8 to 14 between 1980 and 2008 Being overweight as a child has become an increasingly important indicator for later development of obesity and noninfectious diseases such as heart disease In several western European nations the prevalence of overweight and obese children rose by 10 from 1980 to 1990 a rate that has begun to accelerate recently Vitamin and mineral malnutrition vitamins and minerals are essential to the proper functioning and maintenance of the human body Globally particularly in developing nations deficiencies in Iodine Iron and Zinc among others are said to impair human health when these minerals are not ingested in an adequate quantity There are 20 trace elements and minerals that are essential in small quantities to body function and overall human health Iron deficiency is the most common inadequate nutrient worldwide affecting approximately 2 billion people Globally anemia affects 16 billion people and represents a public health emergency in children under five and mothers The World Health Organization estimates that there exists 469 million women of reproductive age and approximately 600 million preschool and schoolage children worldwide who are anemic Anemia especially irondeficient anemia is a critical problem for cognitive developments in children and its presence leads to maternal deaths and poor brain and motor development in children The development of anemia affects mothers and children more because infants and children have higher iron requirements for growth Health consequences for iron deficiency in young children include increased perinatal mortality delayed mental and physical development negative behavioral consequences reduced auditory and visual function and impaired physical performance The harm caused by iron deficiency during child development cannot be reversed and result in reduced academic performance poor physical work capacity and decreased productivity in adulthood Mothers are also very susceptible to irondeficient anemia because women lose iron during menstruation and rarely supplement it in their diet Maternal iron deficiency anemia increases the chances of maternal mortality contributing to at least 18 of maternal deaths in low and middle income countries Vitamin A plays an essential role in developing the immune system in children therefore it is considered an essential micronutrient that can greatly affect health However because of the expense of testing for deficiencies many developing nations have not been able to fully detect and address vitamin A deficiency leaving vitamin A deficiency considered a silent hunger According to estimates subclinical vitamin A deficiency characterized by low retinol levels affects 190 million preschool children and 19 million mothers worldwide The WHO estimates that 52 million of these children under 5 are affected by night blindness which is considered clinical vitamin A deficiency Severe vitamin A deficiency VAD for developing children can result in visual impairments anemia and weakened immunity and increase their risk of morbidity and mortality from infectious disease This also presents a problem for women with WHO estimating that 98 million women are affected by night blindness Clinical vitamin A deficiency is particularly common among pregnant women with prevalence rates as high as 98 in SouthEast Asia Estimates say that 285 of the global population is iodine deficient representing 188 billion individuals Although salt iodization programs have reduced the prevalence of iodine deficiency this is still a public health concern in 32 nations Moderate deficiencies are common in Europe and Africa and over consumption is common in the Americas Iodinedeficient diets can interfere with adequate thyroid hormone production which is responsible for normal growth in the brain and nervous system This ultimately leads to poor school performance and impaired intellectual capabilities Infant and young child feeding Improvement of breast feeding practices like early initiation and exclusive breast feeding for the first two years of life could save the lives of 15 million children annually Nutrition interventions targeted at infants aged 0‚Äì5 months first encourages early initiation of breastfeeding Though the relationship between early initiation of breast feeding and improved health outcomes has not been formally established a recent study in Ghana suggests a causal relationship between early initiation and reduced infectioncaused neonatal deaths Also experts promote exclusive breastfeeding rather than using formula which has shown to promote optimal growth development and health of infants Exclusive breastfeeding often indicates nutritional status because infants that consume breast milk are more likely to receive all adequate nourishment and nutrients that will aid their developing body and immune system This leaves children less likely to contract diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections Besides the quality and frequency of breastfeeding the nutritional status of mothers affects infant health When mothers do not receive proper nutrition it threatens the wellness and potential of their children Wellnourished women are less likely to experience risks of birth and are more likely to deliver children who will develop well physically and mentally Maternal undernutrition increases the chances of lowbirth weight which can increase the risk of infections and asphyxia in fetuses increasing the probability of neonatal deaths Growth failure during intrauterine conditions associated with improper mother nutrition can contribute to lifelong health complications Approximately 13 million children are born with intrauterine growth restriction annually International food insecurity and malnutrition  According to UNICEF South Asia has the highest levels of underweight children under five followed by subSaharan Africans nations with Industrialized countries and Latin nations having the lowest rates United States In the United States 2 of children are underweight with under 1 stunted and 6 are wasting In the US dietitians are registered RD or licensed LD with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association and are only able to use the title dietitian as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination respectively In California registered dietitians must abide by the Business and Professions Code of Section 258525868 Archived from the original on 20100111\\xa0Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist including unqualified dietitians as this term is unregulated Some states such as the State of Florida have begun to include the title nutritionist in state licensure requirements Most governments provide guidance on nutrition and some also impose mandatory disclosurelabeling requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance In the US nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of a plate of food which in 2011 superseded the MyPyramid food pyramid that had replaced the Four Food Groups The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry Committee Committee hearings are often televised on CSPAN The US Department of Health and Human Services provides a sample weeklong menu which fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government Canadas Food Guide is another governmental recommendation Industrialized countries According to UNICEF the Commonwealth of Independent States has the lowest rates of stunting and wasting at 14 percent and 3 percent The nations of Estonia Finland Iceland Lithuania and Sweden have the lowest prevalence of low birthweight children in the world at 4 Proper prenatal nutrition is responsible for this small prevalence of low birthweight infants However low birthweight rates are increasing due to the use of fertility drugs resulting in multiple births women bearing children at an older age and the advancement of technology allowing more preterm infants to survive Industrialized nations more often face malnutrition in the form of overnutrition from excess calories and nonnutritious carbohydrates which has contributed greatly to the public health epidemic of obesity Disparities according to gender geographic location and socioeconomic position both within and between countries represent the biggest threat to child nutrition in industrialized countries These disparities are a direct product of social inequalities and social inequalities are rising throughout the industrialized world particularly in Europe South Asia South Asia has the highest percentage and number of underweight children under five in the world at approximately 78 million children Patterns of stunting and wasting are similar where 44 have not reached optimal height and 15 are wasted rates much higher than any other regions This region of the world has extremely high rates of child underweight 46 of its child population under five is underweight India Bangladesh and Pakistan alone account for half the globe‚Äôs underweight child population South Asian nations have made progress towards the MDGs considering the rate has decreased from 53 since 1990 however a 17 decrease of underweight prevalence per year will not be sufficient to meet the 2015 goal Some nations such as Afghanistan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka on the other hand have made significant improvements all decreasing their prevalence by half in ten years While India and Pakistan have made modest improvements Nepal has made no significant improvement in underweight child prevalence Other forms of undernutrition have continued to persist with high resistance to improvement such as the prevalence of stunting and wasting which has not changed significantly in the past 10 years Causes of this poor nutrition include energyinsufficient diets poor sanitation conditions and the gender disparities in educational and social status Girls and women face discrimination especially in nutrition status where South Asia is the only region in the world where girls are more likely to be underweight than boys In South Asia 60 of children in the lowest quintile are underweight compared to only 26 in the highest quintile and the rate of reduction of underweight is slower amongst the poorest EasternSouth Africa The Eastern and Southern African nations have shown no improvement since 1990 in the rate of underweight children under five They have also made no progress in halving hunger by 2015 the most prevalent Millennium Development Goal This is due primarily to the prevalence of famine declined agricultural productivity food emergencies drought conflict and increased poverty This along with HIVAIDS has inhibited the nutrition development of nations such as Lesotho Malawi Mozambique Swaziland Zambia and Zimbabwe Botswana has made remarkable achievements in reducing underweight prevalence dropping 4 in 4 years despite its place as the second leader in HIV prevalence amongst adults in the globe South Africa the wealthiest nation in this region has the second lowest proportion of underweight children at 12 but has been steadily increasing in underweight prevalence since 1995 Almost half of Ethiopian children are underweight and along with Nigeria they account for almost onethird of the underweight under five in all of SubSaharan Africa WestCentral Africa WestCentral Africa has the highest rate of children under five underweight in the world Of the countries in this region the Congo has the lowest rate at 14 while the nations of Democratic Republic of the Congo Ghana Guinea Mali Nigeria Senegal and Togo are improving slowly In Gambia rates decreased from 26 to 17 in four years and their coverage of vitamin A supplementation reaches 91 of vulnerable populations This region has the next highest proportion of wasted children with 10 of the population under five not at optimal weight Little improvement has been made between the years of 1990 and 2004 in reducing the rates of underweight children under five whose rate stayed approximately the same Sierra Leone has the highest child under five mortality rate in the world due predominantly to its extreme infant mortality rate at 238 deaths per 1000 live births Other contributing factors include the high rate of low birthweight children 23 and low levels of exclusive breast feeding 4 Anemia is prevalent in these nations with unacceptable rates of iron deficient anemia The nutritional status of children is further indicated by its high rate of child wasting  10 Wasting is a significant problem in Sahelian countries ‚Äì Burkina Faso Chad Mali Mauritania and Niger ‚Äì where rates fall between 11 and 19 of under fives affecting more than 1 million children Middle EastNorth Africa Six countries in the Middle East and North Africa region are on target to meet goals for reducing underweight children by 2015 and 12 countries have prevalence rates below 10 However the nutrition of children in the region as a whole has degraded for the past ten years due to the increasing portion of underweight children in three populous nations ‚Äì Iraq Sudan and Yemen Forty six percent of all children in Yemen are underweight a percentage that has worsened by 4 since 1990 In Yemen 53 of children under five are stunted and 32 are born at low birth weight Sudan has an underweight prevalence of 41 and the highest proportion of wasted children in the region at 16 One percent of households in Sudan consume iodized salt Iraq has also seen an increase in child underweight since 1990 Djibouti Jordan the Occupied Palestinian Territory OPT Oman the Syrian Arab Republic and Tunisia are all projected to meet minimum nutrition goals with OPT Syrian AR and Tunisia the fastest improving regions This region demonstrates that undernutrition does not always improve with economic prosperity where the United Arab Emirates for example despite being a wealthy nation has similar child death rates due to malnutrition to those seen in Yemen East AsiaPacific The East AsiaPacific region has reached its goals on nutrition in part due to the improvements contributed by China the region‚Äôs most populous country China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002 China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004 halving the prevalence This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000 They also have a low birthweight rate at 4 a rate comparable to industrialized countries and over 90 of households receive adequate iodized salts However large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas where 5 provinces in China leave 15 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases Singapore Vietnam Malaysia and Indonesia are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs Singapore has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation besides Iceland in the world at 3 Cambodia has the highest rate of child mortality in the region 141 per 1000 live births while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45 in 2000 Further nutrient indicators show that only 12 per cent of Cambodian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 14 per cent of households consume iodized salt Latin AmericaCaribbean This region has undergone the fastest progress in decreasing poor nutrition status of children in the world The Latin American region has reduced underweight children prevalence by 38 every year between 1990 and 2004 with a current rate of 7 underweight They also have the lowest rate of child mortality in the developing world with only 31 per 1000 deaths and the highest iodine consumption Cuba has seen improvement from 9 to 4 percent underweight under 5 between 1996 and 2004 The prevalence has also decreased in the Dominican Republic Jamaica Peru and Chile Chile has a rate of underweight under 5 at merely 1 The most populous nations Brazil and Mexico mostly have relatively low rates of underweight under 5 with only 6 and 8 Guatemala has the highest percentage of underweight and stunted children in the region with rates above 45 There are disparities amongst different populations in this region For example children in rural areas have twice the prevalence of underweight at 13 compared to urban areas at 5 Nutrition access disparities Occurring throughout the world lack of proper nutrition is both a consequence and cause of poverty Impoverished individuals are less likely to have access to nutritious food and to escape from poverty than those who have healthy diets Disparities in socioeconomic status both between and within nations provide the largest threat to child nutrition in industrialized nations where social inequality is on the rise According to UNICEF children living in the poorest households are twice as likely to be underweight as those in the richest Those in the lowest wealth quintile and whose mothers have the least education demonstrate the highest rates of child mortality and stunting Throughout the developing world socioeconomic inequality in childhood malnutrition is more severe than in upper income brackets regardless of the general rate of malnutrition Concurrently the greatest increase in childhood obesity has been seen in the lower middle income bracket According to UNICEF children in rural locations are more than twice as likely to be underweight as compared to children under five in urban areas In Latin AmericanCaribbean nations ‚ÄúChildren living in rural areas in Bolivia Honduras Mexico and Nicaragua are more than twice as likely to be underweight as children living in urban areas That likelihood doubles to four times in Peru‚Äù  In the United States the incidence of low birthweight is on the rise among all populations but particularly among minorities According to UNICEF boys and girls have almost identical rates as underweight children under age 5 across the world except in South Asia Nutrition policy Nutrition interventions Nutrition directly influences progress towards meeting the Millennium Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty through health and education Therefore nutrition interventions take a multifaceted approach to improve the nutrition status of various populations Policy and programming must target both individual behavioral changes and policy approaches to public health While most nutrition interventions focus on delivery through the healthsector nonhealth sector interventions targeting agriculture water and sanitation and education are important as well Global nutrition micronutrient deficiencies often receive largescale solution approaches by deploying large governmental and nongovernmental organizations For example in 1990 iodine deficiency was particularly prevalent with one in five households or 17 billion people not consuming adequate iodine leaving them at risk to develop associated diseases Therefore a global campaign to iodize salt to eliminate iodine deficiency successfully boosted the rate to 69 of households in the world consuming adequate amounts of iodine Emergencies and crises often exacerbate undernutrition due to the aftermath of crises that include food insecurity poor health resources unhealthy environments and poor healthcare practices Therefore the repercussions of natural disasters and other emergencies can exponentially increase the rates of macro and micronutrient deficiencies in populations Disaster relief interventions often take a multifaceted public health approach UNICEF‚Äôs programming targeting nutrition services amongst disaster settings include nutrition assessments measles immunization vitamin A supplementation provision of fortified foods and micronutrient supplements support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding for infants and young children and therapeutic and supplementary feeding For example during Nigeria‚Äôs food crisis of 2005 300000 children received therapeutic nutrition feeding programs through the collaboration of UNICEF the Niger government the World Food Programme and 24 NGOs utilizing community and facility based feeding schemes Interventions aimed at pregnant women infants and children take a behavioral and programbased approach Behavioral intervention objectives include promoting proper breastfeeding the immediate initiation of breastfeeding and its continuation through 2 years and beyond UNICEF recognizes that to promote these behaviors healthful environments must be established conducive to promoting these behaviors like healthy hospital environments skilled health workers support in the public and workplace and removing negative influences Finally other interventions include provisions of adequate micro and macro nutrients such as iron anemia and vitamin A supplements and vitaminfortified foods and readytouse products Programs addressing micronutrient deficiencies such as those aimed at anemia have attempted to provide iron supplementation to pregnant and lactating women However because supplementation often occurs too late these programs have had little effect Interventions such as women‚Äôs nutrition early and exclusive breastfeeding appropriate complementary food and micronutrient supplementation have proven to reduce stunting and other manifestations of undernutrition A Cochrane review of communitybased maternal health packages showed that this communitybased approach improved the initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth Some programs have had adverse effects One example is the ‚ÄúFormula for Oil‚Äù relief program in Iraq which resulted in the replacement of breastfeeding for formula which has negatively affected infant nutrition Implementation and delivery platforms In April 2010 the World Bank and the IMF released a policy briefing entitled ‚ÄúScaling up Nutrition SUN A Framework for action‚Äù that represented a partnered effort to address the Lancet‚Äôs Series on under nutrition and the goals it set out for improving under nutrition They emphasized the 1000 days after birth as the prime window for effective nutrition intervention encouraging programming that was costeffective and showed significant cognitive improvement in populations as well as enhanced productivity and economic growth This document was labeled the SUN framework and was launched by the UN General Assembly in 2010 as a road map encouraging the coherence of stakeholders like governments academia UN system organizations and foundations in working towards reducing under nutrition The SUN framework has initiated a transformation in global nutrition calling for countrybased nutrition programs increasing evidence based and cost‚Äìeffective interventions and ‚Äúintegrating nutrition within national strategies for gender equality agriculture food security social protection education water supply sanitation and health care‚Äù Government often plays a role in implementing nutrition programs through policy For instance several East Asian nations have enacted legislation to increase iodization of salt to increase household consumption Political commitment in the form of evidencebased effective national policies and programs trained skilled community nutrition workers and effective communication and advocacy can all work to decrease malnutrition Market and industrial production can play a role as well For example in the Philippines improved production and market availability of iodized salt increased household consumption While most nutrition interventions are delivered directly through governments and health services other sectors such as agriculture water and sanitation and education are vital for nutrition promotion as well Nutrition Education   Nutrition is taught in schools in many countries In England and Wales the Personal and Social Education and Food Technology curricula include nutrition stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging In many schools a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments In some American schools students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes Nutrition is offered at many schools and if it is not a class of its own nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as Life Skills Independent Living Single Survival Freshmen Connection Health etc In many Nutrition classes students learn about the food groups the food pyramid Daily Recommended Allowances calories vitamins minerals malnutrition physical activity healthy food choices and how to live a healthy life A 1985 US National Research Council report entitled Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate Only 20 of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate required course A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30 Nutrition for special populations Sports nutrition  Individuals with highly active lifestyles require more nutrients Furthermore recent studies declared that increasing dietary intake of carbohydrates proteins and Vitamin D may be part of improving athletes level of performance  Protein  The protein requirement for each individual differs as do opinions about whether and to what extent physically active people require more protein The 2005 Recommended Dietary Allowances RDA aimed at the general healthy adult population provide for an intake of 08 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight A review panel stating that no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise Carbohydrates The main fuel used by the body during exercise is carbohydrates which is stored in muscle as glycogen ‚Äì a form of sugar During exercise muscle glycogen reserves can be used up especially when activities last longer than 90\\xa0min Because the amount of glycogen stored in the body is limited it is important for athletes to replace glycogen by consuming a diet high in carbohydrates Meeting energy needs can help improve performance during the sport as well as improve overall strength and endurance There are different kinds of carbohydrates simple for example from fruits and complex for example from grains such as wheat Simple sugars can be from an unrefined natural source or may be refined and added to processed food A typical American consumes about 50 of their carbohydrates as refined sugars Over the course of a year the average American consumes 204 litres 54 US gallons of soft drinks which contain the highest amount of added sugars Different types of carbohydrates are not all equally healthful When machinery has been used to remove bits of high fiber the carbohydrates are refined These are the carbohydrates found in white bread and fast food Maternal nutrition Studies have shown that nutritional status of women preconception specifically body weight has an influence on foetal growth However during pregnancy nutritional intake by the mother is believed not to have any effect during the first and second trimesters but maternal nutritional intake in the last trimester is widely believed to have some effect on the foetal growth and therefore maternal nutrition plays a vital role in the development and growth of the foetus Paediatric nutrition Adequate nutrition is essential for the growth of children from infancy right through until adolescence Some nutrients are specifically required for growth on top of nutrients required for normal body maintenance in particular calcium and iron Elderly nutrition Chwang 2012 reports that malnutrition is higher among the elderly This article highlights the uneven distribution of nutrients between developed and undeveloped countries For example most European countries has a high fat intake while the Malaysian elderly were found to have insufficient intake of calcium thiamine and riboflavin History Humans have evolved as omnivorous huntergatherers over the past 250000 years The diet of early modern humans varied significantly depending on location and climate The diet in the tropics tended to depend more heavily on plant foods while the diet at higher latitudes tended more towards animal products Analyses of postcranial and cranial remains of humans and animals from the Neolithic along with detailed bonemodification studies have shown that cannibalism also occurred among prehistoric humans Agriculture developed about 10000 years ago in multiple locations throughout the world providing grains such as wheat rice and maize and potatoes and originating staples such as bread pasta attested from 1154 and tortillas Farming also provided milk and dairy products and sharply increased the availability of meats and the diversity of vegetables The importance of food purity was recognized when bulk storage led to infestation and contamination risksCooking developed as an often ritualistic activity due to efficiency and reliability concerns requiring adherence to strict recipes and procedures and in response to demands for food purity and consistency From antiquity to 1900  Around 3000 BC the Vedic texts made mention of scientific research on nutrition The Bibles Book of Daniel recounts first recorded nutritional experiment During an invasion of Judah King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon captured Daniel and his friends Selected as court servants they were to share in the kings fine foods and wine But they objected preferring vegetables pulses and water in accordance with their Jewish dietary restrictions The kings chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial Daniel and his friends received their diet for 10 days On comparison with the kings men they appeared healthier and were allowed to continue with their diet Around 475 BC Anaxagoras stated that food is absorbed by the human body and therefore contained homeomerics generative components suggesting the existence of nutrients Around 400 BC Hippocrates said Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food The 16thcentury scientist and artist Leonardo da Vinci 1452‚Äì1519 compared metabolism to a burning candle In 1747 Dr James Lind a physician in the British navy performed the first attested scientific nutrition experiment discovering that lime juice saved sailors who had been at sea for years from scurvy a deadly and painful bleeding disorder The discovery was ignored for forty years but after about 1850 British sailors became known as limeys Scientists would not identify the essential vitamin C within lime juice until the 1930s Around 1770 Antoine Lavoisier the Father of Nutrition and Chemistry discovered the details of metabolism demonstrating that the oxidation of food is the source of body heat In 1790 George Fordyce recognized calcium as necessary for fowl survival In the early 19th century the elements carbon nitrogen hydrogen and oxygen were recognized as the primary components of food and methods to measure their proportions were developed In 1816 Fran√ßois Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates and fat lost their body protein and died in a few weeks but dogs also fed protein survived identifying protein as an essential dietary component In 1840 Justus Liebig discovered the chemical makeup of carbohydrates sugars fats fatty acids and proteins amino acids In the 1860s Claude Bernard discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogenIn the early 1880s Kanehiro Takaki observed that Japanese sailors whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice developed beriberi or endemic neuritis a disease causing heart problems and paralysis but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease In 1896 Eugen Baumann observed iodine in thyroid glands In 1897 Christiaan Eijkman worked with natives of Java who also suffered from beriberi Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice demonstrating that food can cure disease Over two decades later nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B From 1900 to the present In the early 20th century Carl von Voit and Max Rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals applying principles of physics in nutrition In 1906 Wilcock and Hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan was necessary for the survival of rats He fed them a special mixture of food containing all the nutrients he believed were essential for survival but the rats died A second group of rats to which he also fed an amount of milk containing vitamins Gowland Hopkins recognized accessory food factors other than calories protein and minerals as organic materials essential to health but which the body cannot synthesize In 1907 Stephen M Babcock and Edwin B Hart conducted the singlegrain experiment This experiment ran through 1911 In 1912 Casimir Funk coined the term vitamin to label a vital factor in the diet from the words vital and amine because these unknown substances preventing scurvy beriberi and pellagra were thought then to derive from ammonia The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century In 1913 Elmer McCollum discovered the first vitamins fatsoluble vitamin A and watersoluble vitamin B in 1915 later identified as a complex of several watersoluble vitamins and named vitamin C as the thenunknown substance preventing scurvy Lafayette Mendel 18721935 and Thomas Osborne 1859‚Äì1929 also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B In 1919 Sir Edward Mellanby incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with codliver oil In 1922 McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil but found it still cured rickets thus identifying vitamin D Also in 1922 HM Evans and LS Bishop discovered vitamin E as essential for rat pregnancy and originally called it food factor X until 1925 In 1925 Hart discovered that iron absorption requires trace amounts of copper In 1927 Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus synthesized vitamin D for which he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928 In 1928 Albert SzentGy√∂rgyi isolated ascorbic acid and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy In 1935 he synthesized it and in 1937 won a Nobel Prize for his efforts SzentGy√∂rgyi concurrently elucidated much of the citric acid cycle In the 1930s William Cumming Rose identified essential amino acids necessary protein components which the body cannot synthesize In 1935 Eric Underwood and Hedley Marston independently discovered the necessity of cobalt In 1936 Eugene Floyd Dubois showed that work and school performance relate to caloric intake In 1938 Erhard Fernholz discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E It was synthesised by Paul Karrer 1889‚Äì1971 From 1940 rationing in the United Kingdom ‚Äì during and after World War II ‚Äì took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by Elsie Widdowson and others In 1941 the National Research Council established the first Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs In 1992 the US Department of Agriculture introduced the Food Guide Pyramid In 2002 a Natural Justice study showed a relation between nutrition and violent behavior In 2005 a study found that in addition to bad nutrition adenovirus may cause obesity See also   Further reading Mahan LK and EscottStump S eds 2000 Krauses Food

       "  'raw page text': 'Interesterified fat is a type of oil where the fatty acids have been moved from one triglyceride molecule to another This is generally done to modify the melting point slow rancidification and create an oil more suitable for deep frying or making margarine with good taste and low saturated fat content It is not the same as partial hydrogenation which produces trans fatty acids but interesterified fats used in the food industry can come from hydrogenated fat for simplicity and frugality    Chemistry Fats such as soybean oil consist mainly of various triglycerides which are made up of a glycerol backbone esterified to three fatty acid molecules The triglycerides contain a mixture of saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids Interesterification is carried out by blending the desired oils and then rearranging the fatty acids over the glycerol backbone with for instance the help of catalysts or lipase enzymes Polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs decrease the melting point of fats significantly A triglyceride containing three saturated fatty acids is generally solid at room temperature and not very desirable for many applications Rearranging these triglycerides with oils containing unsaturated fatty acids lowers the melting point and creates fats with properties better suited for target food products In addition blending interesterified oils with liquid oils allows the reduction in saturated fatty acids in many trans fatty acid free food products The interesterified fats can be separated through controlled crystallization also called fractionation  In vegetable polyunsaturated oils the PUFA is commonly found at the middle position sn2 on the glycerol Stearic acid is not usually found at sn2 in vegetable oils used in the human diet Health effects Reviews Hypotheses In most vegetable dietary fats the palmitic C160 and stearic acid C180 saturated fats mainly occupy the 1 and 3positions of the triacylglycerol molecule whereas an unsaturated fatty acid such as oleic acid 181œâ9 or linoleic acid 182œâ6 usually occupies the 2position In animal fats this is not the case Interesterification of vegetable oils will enhance the amount of saturated fatty acids at the 2position Fatty acids at the 2position are biologically different from fatty acids at the 1 and 3 position because they are handled differently during digestion and metabolism and a relevant scientific question is whether there are health effects following from this Although this question has received relatively little attention in dietary fats and health research there are a number of good controlled human intervention studies that have addressed it In studies addressing the health effects of interesterification as such a diet high in interesterified fat should be compared with a diet high in a noninteresterified fat with the same fatty acid composition If the two diets show similar changes in the resulting blood lipid profiles ie not different from each other this indicates interesterification has no effect on metabolism or biological effects Conversely effects of interesterification cannot be properly addressed if the interesterified fat and the noninteresterified fat being compared have different fatty acid compositions Individual studies Zock et al compared the effects of an IE interesterfied test fat with 40 C160 on the 2position with a noninteresterified test fat with only 65 C160 on the 2position in a 3week diet study Despite the very high intakes and the marked difference in positional distribution no statistically significant effects on fasting blood lipids were observed in the group as a whole Nestel et al examined the effects of an IE fat blend with 25 C160 on the 2position with a native fat blend with only 9 C160 on the 2position Again despite a high intake level and the clear difference in positional distribution of the fats fed no effects were observed on fasting blood lipids Meijer and Weststrate examined the effects of interesterification using a real hardstock as applied in foods The control was the same fat blend with a similar fatty acid composition but not interesterified The IE fat blend contained more C160 on the 2position 18 than the control blend 7 None of the fasting levels of blood lipids measured after 3 weeks showed any change related to treatment of the fat blend Fasting glucose level was also not affected In 1970 Grande et al used interesterification to prepare a blend of fats and oils mimicking the fatty acid composition of cocoa butter No difference between the interesterified fat blend and cocoa butter was observed in levels of total cholesterol in fasting blood Recently in a study funded by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board Sundram et al compared the effects of three types of fat native palm olein a blend with partially hydrogenated soybean oil and an interesterified mixture of oils They concluded both the IE blend and the partially hydrogenated fat blend increased the fasting ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol indicating an adverse effect on CVD risk Sundram et al also found that fasting plasma glucose levels were higher after 4 weeks on the interesterified fat than after the other diets For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve IAUC following the IE meal was 40 greater than after either other meal plt0001 and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and Cpeptide plt005 As was pointed out in a letter to the Editor by Destaillats et al a major limitation of the Sundram study is that the diets differed in overall fatty acid composition The interesterified fat had 30 more saturated and 57 less monounsaturated fatty acids than the untreated palm olein The direction of the effects on blood lipids are in line with what can be predicted based on these differences in fatty acid content between the study diets Mensink 2003 Another recent study by Berry et al compared shea butter 3 C180 on the 2position and interesterified shea butter 23 C180 on the 2position while keeping overall fatty acid composition of the diets constant This study found no effects of interesterification on fasting levels of blood lipids glucose and insulin This is line with a number of other human intervention studies Christophe et al have studied the effect of interesterification of butter oil In a small pilot study they observed an 11 lower blood total cholesterol level after interesterification However in a larger better designed study the same authors could not reproduce the cholesterollowering effects

       "  'raw page text': 'This is a list of nutrition guides A nutrition guide is a reference that provides nutrition advice for general health typically by dividing foods into food groups and recommending servings of each group Nutrition guides can be presented in written or visual form and are commonly published by government agencies health associations and university health departments Most countries also have nutrition facts labels which are not listed here many of those reference specific target amounts for various nutrients    Historical guides Ancient Greece The Hippocratic Corpus of Ancient Greece contains one of the earliest known nutrition guides It recommends a seasonal diet For winter it advises eating a heavy diet of bread and roasted meat and fish while avoiding vegetables and restricting liquids to if anything strong wine It then recommends a lighter summer diet of soft barley cake vegetables boiled meat and large quantities of diluted wine Gradual transitions between these two diets are advised in the intervening months Imperial China During the Tang Dynasty Chinese physician Sun Simiao is believed to have written the first nutrition guide in traditional Chinese medicine In his book Precious Prescriptions for Emergencies Chinese ÂÇôÊÄ•ÂçÉÈáëË¶ÅÊñπ pinyin Beiji qianjin yaofang the chapter Dietary Treatment Chinese È£üÊ≤ª pinyin Shiji contains sections describing the effects of eating fruits vegetables grains and animals First food pyramid Amid high food prices in 1972 Swedens National Board of Health and Welfare developed the idea of basic foods that were both cheap and nutritious and supplemental foods that added nutrition missing from the basic foods KF a consumer coop that worked with the Board sought to illustrate these food groups KF developed a food pyramid because it could depict basic foods as its base and introduced the guide to the public in 1974 in their magazine Vi At the base were bread cereals potatoes milk cheese and margarine above it was a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit and at the top was an apex of supplemental meat fish and eggs The pyramid competed with the National Boards dietary circle which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid KF continued to promote it and food pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries plus West Germany Japan and Sri Lanka The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992 Today both the Swedish government and KF have moved to the Plate Model Government guides Australia The Australian Department of Health and Ageing publishes The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating which features a wheel divided into five sections approximately 40 percent bread cereals rice pasta and noodles 30 percent vegetables and legumes 10 percent fruit 10 percent milk yogurt and cheese and 10 percent lean meat fish poultry eggs nuts and legumes Below the wheel are reminders to drink plenty of water and eat fats and sweets occasionally or in small amounts More specific recommendations are provided based on age gender life stage and activity level Austria The Austrian Federal Ministry of Health uses The Austrian Food Pyramid German Die √ñsterreichische Ern√§hrungspyramide which is divided into 25 blocks each block representing a daily serving from a food group Starting at the base there are six servings of nonalcoholic beverages preferably lowenergy drinks like water tea unsweetened fruit juice and vegetable juice three servings of vegetables and legumes two of fruit four of cereals bread pasta rice and potatoes preferably whole grains three of milk and dairy two white like milk yogurt or cream cheese and one of yellow cheese one of fats and oil preferably olive or canola oil three of meat fish sausage and eggs preferably fish or lean meat and three of fatty sweet and salty foods though not nutritionally recommended and to be consumed rarely Belgium The Voedingsdriehoek is a mostly in Flanders widely used tool for dietitians health educators schools etc to explain a balanced diet The triangle is constructed as a pyramid with five different layers The bottom layer is the largest in area so the most important the top is narrow and there represents little food although it is an essential ingredient The layers are from top to bottom  Oil  fats  Protein meat fish eggs dairy products meat substitutes  Fruits and vegetables  Starch or carbohydrates bread potatoes rice pasta etc  Drinks In 2005 a rather symbolically layer was added at the bottom sports and exercise This is not a food but an important part of a healthy diet and lifestyle The information services use the active food pyramid Brazil Brazils Ministry of Health publishes the Food Guide Portuguese Guia Alimentar which features a map of Brazil depicting each of Brazils five regions as puzzle pieces representing a food group However Brazils food recommendations differ from the map and feature eight food groups rice bread pasta potato and cassavas 5 servings a day vegetables and legumes 3 servings fruits 3 milk cheese and yogurt 3 beans 1 meat fish and eggs 1 oils and fats 1 and sugars and sweets no more than one Canada  Canadas Food Guide from Health Canada is illustrated with a rainbow of four food groups vegetables and fruit 7 to 10 servings a day for adults depending on biological sex grain products 6 to 8 milk and alternatives 2 and meat and alternatives 2 to 3 More specific recommendations are provided based on age gender and life stage Canada developed its first nutrition guide in 1942 as part of its wartime nutrition program China Chinas Ministry of Health uses the Balanced Diet Pagoda Chinese Âπ≥Ë°°ËÜ≥È£üÂÆùÂ°î which is divided into five stories ascending from largest to smallest Cereals are at the large base topped by vegetables and fruits then fish poultry meat eggs and other animal foods followed by milk and soy foods and topped with fats and oils in the small spire Beside the pagoda are images representing water and exercise Denmark Denmarks Food Administration uses the Diet Compass Danish Kostkompasset to depict its Dietary 8 Danish 8 kostr√•d guidelines with an image on each compass point representing a guideline Those guidelines are Eat 6 fruits and vegetables a day Eat fish and seafood several times a week Eat potatoes rice or pasta and whole wheat bread every day Cut back on sugar Cut back on greasy foods Eat a varied diet and maintain a normal weight Quench your thirst with water and Be physically active at least 30 minutes a day France Frances National Institute for Prevention and Health Education has 25 separate food guides under the title The Food Guide For All French Le Guide Alimentaire Pour Tous Each guide is based on a consumers personality habits and lifestyle There are guides for people who are healthconscious dont care about food prepare family meals are poor eat at restaurants skip meals dont cook have large appetites are on diets prefer certain foods avoid various foods including meat are sedentary are athletic and more Each guide features a portrait in the image of a happy face designed out of foods representing that consumers type The portraits are billed as nutrition recommendations though they are more decorative than informative Germany Germanys statefunded Aid Information Service uses the Food Pyramid German Ern√§hrungspyramide which divides a pyramid into 22 blocks each block representing a handsized serving from a food group Starting at the base there are six blocks for beverages three for vegetables two for fruit four for grains three for dairy one for meat and fish one for oils one for fats and one for sweets and alcohol Beverages vegetables fruit and grains are marked green for free travel meat and dairy are marked yellow for caution and oils fats sweets and alcohol are marked red for brake lights Aid also collaborated with the German Nutrition Society to create a 3D pyramid model India Indias National Institute of Nutrition publishes the Dietary Guidelines for Indians which among other diagrams includes the Food Pyramid The pyramid has a base of beans and legumes to eat adequately a second layer of vegetables and fruit to eat liberally a third layer of meat fish eggs and oils to eat moderately and an apex of fatty salty and sugary foods to eat sparingly Accompanying the pyramid is a recommendation of regular exercise and physical activity as well as warnings against drinking alcohol and smoking Ireland The island of Irelands Food Safety Promotion Board uses The Food Pyramid which is divided into five levels bread cereals and potatoes at the large base 6 or more servings then fruit and vegetables 5 followed by milk cheese and yogurt 3 then meat fish eggs and alternatives 2 and finally fats high fatsugar snacks foods and drinks at the apex small amounts At least 8 cups of water a day are also recommended Israel The Food Pyramid Hebrew ◊§◊ô◊®◊û◊ô◊ì◊™ ◊î◊û◊ñ◊ï◊ü\\u200e\\u200e from Israels Ministry of Health is

Spanish El Plato del Bien Comer which is divided into thirds vegetables and fruits in equal proportion cereals and legumes and animal products The guide further recommends eating many vegetables and fruits and enough cereals The legume and animal products section is subdivided and few animal products are recommended while the guide recommends combining the larger legume section with cereals Additional recommendations are to include each of the three food groups in each of the three main meals of the day to eat the greatest possible variety of food to eat according to individual needs and conditions and to eat the least possible fats oils sugar and salt Netherlands The Netherlands Nutrition Center uses the Wheel of Five Dutch De Schijf van Vijf which is divided into five groups approximately 30 percent vegetables and fruit 30 percent bread cereals potatoes rice pasta couscous and legumes 16 percent dairy meat fish eggs and meat substitutes 16 percent beverages and 8 percent fats and oils More specific recommendations are provided based on age and gender South Korea South Koreas Korean Nutrition Society uses the Food Bicycle Korean ÏãùÌíàÍµ¨ÏÑ± ÏûêÏ†ÑÍ±∞ with a small

model very similar to Chinas current guide Spain Spains Ministry of Health Social Policy and Equality uses the NAOS Pyramid Spanish Pir√°mide NAOS which promotes a Mediterranean diet as well as plenty of physical activity and is drawn as a sailboat on water It is divided into beverages and water at the base an equal division between physical activity and a combination of grains vegetables tubers fruit olive oil and dairy in the second level which is labeled several times a day and colorcoded green an equal division between sports and a combination of meat fish eggs legumes and nuts in the third level which is labeled several times a week and is colorcoded orange and an apex of saturated fats sugars salt and sedentary activity labeled occasionally and colorcoded red Sweden Swedens Food Agency uses the Plate Model Swedish Tallriksmodellen which divides a plate into approximately 40 percent potatoes rice pasta and bread 40 percent vegetables and fruit and 20 percent meat fish eggs and legumes People requiring more energy are allowed a larger share of carbohydrates while people who are overweight can make up to half their plate vegetables and fruit Previously Sweden used the Dietary Circle created in 1963 while Swedish consumer cooperative KF created the worlds first food pyramid in 1974 Switzerland Switzerlands Federal Office of Public Health uses the Food Pyramid German Lebensmittelpyramide developed by the Swiss Society for Nutrition At the base is 1 to 2 liters of liquids preferably nonsugared beverages then three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit of different colors followed by whole grains beans cereals and potatoes to be eaten with each meal then three servings of milk or dairy one serving of meat fish eggs cheese or another protein oils fats

Gruplarƒ± a fourpart division of milk and dairy meat eggs fish legumes and seeds vegetables and fruit and bread and cereal Each food group is accompanied by bullet points such as serving recommendations or advice to eat more raw vegetables and whole grains United Kingdom   The United Kingdoms Department of Health published Dietary Reference Values These are equivalent to the easier to understand Eatwell plate used by the National Health Service This consists of roughly onethird fruit and vegetables at least 5 portions onethird bread rice potatoes and pasta plenty a smaller amount of milk and dairy some meat fish eggs and beans in the same proportion as dairy some and a small wedge of fatty and sugary foods United States   In the United States the Department of Agriculture uses MyPlate a plate icon divided into approximately 30 percent grains 30 percent vegetables 20 percent fruits and 20 percent protein accompanied by a smaller circle representing dairy Additional recommendations include to enjoy food but eat less avoid oversized portions make at least half of grains whole switch to fatfree or lowfat milk choose foods with less sodium and drink water instead of sugary drinks Previous USDA food guides include the Basic 7 1943‚Äì1956 the Basic Four 1956‚Äì1992 the Food Guide Pyramid 1992‚Äì2005 and MyPyramid 2005‚Äì2011 The National Institutes of Health uses the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension DASH Eating Plan for people seeking to lower their blood pressure DASH differs from MyPlate in that the protein category is replaced by a smaller proportion of lean meats poultry and fish there are separate sections for fats and oils legumes and sweets and fruits and vegetables dont constitute half of the diet The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in the USDA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services jointly release a longer textual document called Dietary Guidelines for Americans updated in 2010 with the next scheduled revision in 2015 Dietary Reference Intake values are published by the Institute of Medicine for general use but nutrition facts labels in the US use the older Reference Daily Intake standards instead World Health Organization The World Health Organization uses The 3 Fives a guide featuring five key points in each of three categories The three categories are safer food a healthy diet and appropriate physical activity In the healthy diet category the five keys are Give your baby only breast milk for the first 6 months of life Eat a variety of food Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit Eat moderate amounts of fats and oil and Eat less salt and sugar Each key includes bullet points with further recommendations The 3 Fives was originally developed for distribution at major sporting events like the Olympics and the World Cup but it can also be used for general audiences Before The 3 Fives the WHO used the CINDI dietary guide which included the CINDI pyramid The guide was intended to help European health professionals and policymakers develop their own national nutrition guides The pyramid has a large green base representing approximately twothirds of the triangles area which is filled with vegetables fruits grains and starches A middle layer shaded orange for caution is divided into two equal sections lowfat milk and dairy and beans lentils legumes fish eggs poultry and lean meat At the top is a small red zone of fats and sweets Food and Agriculture Organization FAO FAO provides technical assistance to countries for developing revising and implementing foodbased dietary guidelines FBDG and food guides in line with current scientific evidence FAO also carries out periodic reviews on progress made in the development and use of dietary guidelines FAOs food based dietary guidelines website collects more than 80 national guidelines Other guides The American Diabetes Association uses the Create Your Plate system which divides a plate into three sections nonstarchy vegetables the largest section starchy foods and meat or meat substitutes Like MyPlate the ADA complements its plate with a glass of lowfat or nonfat milk The German Nutrition Society German Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Ern√§hrung publishes the Food Circle German Ern√§hrungskreis which is divided into 30 percent cereals and potatoes 26 percent vegetables and salad 17 percent fruit 18 percent milk and dairy 7 percent meat sausage fish and eggs and 2 percent fats and oils Beverages represented by a glass of water are placed in the middle of the circle The Harvard School of Public Health uses the Healthy Eating Pyramid which is split into nine sections including a base of daily exercise and weight control Compared to MyPlate grains become whole grains with refined grains in a use sparingly category protein is split between fish poultry and eggs and nuts seeds beans and tofu with red meat and processed meat in a use sparingly category healthy fats and oils have their own section and dairy can be substituted with calcium and vitamin D supplements To the side of the pyramid are alcohol in moderation and a daily multivitamin The Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services uses the Plate Method which shows a plate that is onehalf fruits and vegetables onequarter grains and starches and onequarter meat and protein Overall Nutritional Quality Index The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine uses the Power Plate which promotes a vegan diet and is divided into equal parts fruit grains legumes and vegetables The University of Michigan Health System uses the Healing Foods Pyramid which consists of 11 sections including a base of water Compared to MyPlate it adds sections for legumes seasonings healthy fats and eggs Lean meats are in a weekly category as are fish and seafood An optional category includes alcohol tea and dark chocolate The LiveWell for LIFE project uses National Plates to show the ideal composition of diets in various EU countries that are both healthy environmentally sustainable and affordable This concept was pioneered by WWF in the UK and is now financially supported by the European Commission under the LIFE Plus

       "  'raw page text': 'Malnutrition is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems It may involve calories protein carbohydrates vitamins or minerals Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition Malnutrition is often used to specifically refer to undernutrition where an individual is not getting enough calories protein or micronutrients If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy or before two years of age it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development Extreme undernourishment known as starvation may have symptoms that include a short height thin body very poor energy levels and swollen legs and abdomen People also often get infections and are frequently cold The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking Undernourishment is most often due to not enough highquality food being available to eat This is often related to high food prices and poverty A lack of breastfeeding may contribute as may a number of infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis pneumonia malaria and measles which increase nutrient requirements There are two main types of undernutrition proteinenergy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies Proteinenergy malnutrition has two severe forms marasmus a lack of protein and calories and kwashiorkor a lack of just protein Common micronutrient deficiencies include a lack of iron iodine and vitamin A During pregnancy due to the bodys increased need deficiencies may become more common In some developing countries overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery Efforts to improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding In young children providing food in addition to breastmilk between six months and two years of age improves outcomes There is also good evidence supporting the supplementation of a number of micronutrients to women during pregnancy and among young children in the developing world To get food to people who need it most both delivering food and providing money so people can buy food within local markets are effective Simply feeding students at school is insufficient Management of severe malnutrition within the persons home with readytouse therapeutic foods is possible much of the time In those who have severe malnutrition complicated by other health problems treatment in a hospital setting is recommended This often involves managing low blood sugar and body temperature addressing dehydration and gradual feeding Routine antibiotics are usually recommended due to the high risk of infection Longerterm measures include improving agricultural practices reducing poverty improving sanitation and the empowerment of women There were 793\\xa0million undernourished people in the world in 2015 13 of the total population This is a reduction of 216\\xa0million people since 1990 when 23 were undernourished In 2012 it was estimated that another billion people had a lack of vitamins and minerals In 2015 proteinenergy malnutrition was estimated to have resulted in 323000 deaths‚Äîdown from 510000 deaths in 1990 Other nutritional deficiencies which include iodine deficiency and iron deficiency anemia result in another 83000 deaths In 2010 malnutrition was the cause of 14 of all disability adjusted life years About a third of deaths in children are believed to be due to undernutrition although the deaths are rarely labelled as such In 2010 it was estimated to have contributed to about 15 million deaths in women and children though some estimate the number may be greater than 3\\xa0million An additional 165\\xa0million children were estimated to have stunted growth from malnutrition in 2013 Undernutrition is more common in developing countries Certain groups have higher rates of undernutrition including women‚Äîin particular while pregnant or breastfeeding‚Äîchildren under five years of age and the elderly In the elderly undernutrition becomes more common due to physical psychological and social factors  Definitions  Unless specifically mentioned otherwise the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article Malnutrition can be divided into two different types SAM and MAM SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition Undernutrition and overnutrition Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which nutrients are not enough or are too much such that it causes health problems It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and overnutrition Overnutrition can result in obesity and being overweight In some developing countries overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition However the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation Therefore malnutrition in documents by the World Health Organization UNICEF Save the Children or other international nongovernmental organizations NGOs usually is equated to undernutrition Proteinenergy malnutrition Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of protein‚Äìenergy malnutrition PEM While other include both micronutrient deficiencies and protein energy malnutrition in its definition It differs from calorie restriction in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding The term severe malnutrition or severe undernutrition is often used to refer specifically to PEM PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency Two forms of PEM are kwashiorkor and marasmus and they commonly coexist Kwashiorkor Kwashiorkor is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake The main symptoms are edema wasting liver enlargement hypoalbuminaemia steatosis and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly which is deceiving of actual nutritional status The term means ‚Äòdisplaced child‚Äô and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa means the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates Marasmus Marasmus ‚Äòto waste away‚Äô is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy The main symptoms are severe wasting leaving little or no edema minimal subcutaneous fat severe muscle wasting and nonnormal serum albumin levels Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival It is traditionally seen in famine significant food restriction or more severe cases of anorexia Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression Undernutrition hunger Undernutrition encompasses stunted growth stunting wasting and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals collectively referred to as micronutrients The term hunger which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating has been used to describe undernutrition especially in reference to food insecurity Definition by Gomez In 1956 G√≥mez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished undernourished children in a hospital in Mexico City Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition first second and third degree The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition An adaptation of Gomezs original classification is still used today While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations the classification has been criticized for being arbitrary and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition Also height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition Definition by Waterlow John Conrad Waterlow established a new classification for malnutrition Instead of using just weight for age measurements the classification established by Waterlow combines weightforheight indicating acute episodes of malnutrition with heightforage to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known These classifications of malnutrition are commonly used with some modifications by WHO Effects  Malnutrition increases the risk of infection and infectious disease and moderate malnutrition weakens every part of the immune system For example it is a major risk factor in the onset of active tuberculosis Protein and energy malnutrition and deficiencies of specific micronutrients including iron zinc and vitamins increase susceptibility to infection Malnutrition affects HIV transmission by increasing the risk of transmission from mother to child and also increasing replication of the virus In communities or areas that lack access to safe drinking water these additional health risks present a critical problem Lower energy and impaired function of the brain also represent the downward spiral of malnutrition as victims are less able to perform the tasks they need to in order to acquire food earn an income or gain an education Vitamindeficiencyrelated diseases such as scurvy and rickets Hypoglycemia low blood sugar can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy limpness convulsion or loss of consciousness If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly perform a finger or heel stick Signs In those with malnutrition some of the signs of dehydration differ Children however may still be interested in drinking have decreased interactions with the world around them have decreased urine output and may be cool to touch Cognitive development Proteincalorie malnutrition can cause cognitive impairments For humans critical period varies from the final third of gestation to the first 2 years of life Iron deficiency anemia in children under two years of age likely affects brain function acutely and probably also chronically Folate deficiency has been linked to neural tube defects Malnutrition in the form of iodine deficiency is the most common preventable cause of mental impairment worldwide Even moderate deficiency especially in pregnant women and infants lowers intelligence by 10 to 15 IQ points shaving incalculable potential off a nations development The most visible and severe effects ‚Äî disabling goiters cretinism and dwarfism ‚Äî affect a tiny minority usually in mountain villages But 16 percent of the worlds people have at least mild goiter a swollen thyroid gland in the neck Causes   Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices dietary practices and agricultural productivity with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors Clinical malnutrition such as cachexia is a major burden also in developed countries Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition For example the population of a community that is within poor governments may be at risk if the area lacks healthrelated services but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels access to land or levels of education Diseases Malnutrition can be a consequence of health issues such as gastroenteritis or chronic illness especially the HIVAIDS pandemic Diarrhea and other infections can cause malnutrition through decreased nutrient absorption decreased intake of food increased metabolic requirements and direct nutrient loss Parasite infections in particular intestinal worm infections helminthiasis can also lead to malnutrition A leading cause of diarrhea and intestinal worm infections in children in developing countries is lack of sanitation and hygiene People may become malnourished due to abnormal nutrient loss due to diarrhea or chronic illness affecting the small bowel This conditions may include Crohns disease or untreated coeliac disease Malnutrition may also occur due to increased energy expenditure secondary malnutrition Dietary practices Undernutrition A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes continues three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes Deriving too much of ones diet from a single source such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice can cause malnutrition This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition or from only having access to a single food source It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin A deficiency iron deficiency or zinc deficiency can also increase risk of death Overnutrition Overnutrition caused by overeating is also a form of malnutrition In the United States more than half of all adults are now overweight ‚Äî a condition that like hunger increases susceptibility to disease and disability reduces worker productivity and lowers life expectancy Overeating is much more common in the United States where for the majority of people access to food is not an issue Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of nonnutritious food in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a toxic food environment where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility Often fast food low in cost and nutrition is high in calories and heavily promoted When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized automated and more sedentary lifestyles it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid Not only does obesity occur in developed countries problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist In China consumption of highfat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased Overeating leads to many diseases such as heart disease and diabetes that may result in death Poverty and food prices  In Bangladesh poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk meat poultry and fruits As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology the FAO Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses The economist Amartya Sen observed that in recent decades famine has always been a problem of food distribution andor poverty as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world He states that malnutrition and famine were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities causing the 2007‚Äì2008 food price crisis The use of biofuels as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food The United Nations special rapporteur on the right to food Jean Ziegler proposes that agricultural waste such as corn cobs and banana leaves rather than crops themselves be used as fuel Agricultural productivity Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land adverse weather lower farming skills such as crop rotation or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern agriculture such as fertilizers pesticides irrigation machinery and storage facilities As a result of widespread poverty farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer in the name of free market policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers Many if not most farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices leading to low agricultural production and wages and high unaffordable food prices Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on environmental grounds cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the Green Revolution pioneers Norman Borlaug and Keith Rosenberg Future threats There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition Climate change is of importance to food security with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the subtropics and tropics According to the latest IPCC reports temperature increases in these regions are very likely Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition For example the 1998‚Äì2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran Similar figures were present in other nations An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as SubSaharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition Even without an increase of extreme weather events a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species also decreasing food security in these regions Colony collapse disorder is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers Since many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees this represents a threat to the supply of food An epidemic of wheat stem rust caused by race Ug99 is currently spreading across Africa and into Asia and it is feared could wipe out more than 80 percent of the world‚Äôs wheat crops Prevention  Food security  The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides to Asia called the Green Revolution resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available Investments in agriculture such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds increases food harvest and reduces food prices For example in the case of Malawi almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid However after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures farmers produced recordbreaking corn harvests as production leaped to 34 million in 2007 from 12 million in 2005 making Malawi a major food exporter This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo The country has one of the highest prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for DC Proponents for investing in agriculture include Jeffrey Sachs who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa‚Äôs farmers New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition By improving agricultural yields farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build exportled economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market Breastfeeding As of 2016 is estimated that about 821000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding Fortified foods Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt For example flour has been fortified with iron zinc folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine riboflavin niacin and vitamin B12 World population Restricting population size is a proposed solution Thomas Malthus argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through moral restraint Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth However there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population Instead these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems For example Amartya Sen advocates that no matter how a famine is caused methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the public distribution system This applies not only to organizing rationing and control but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation Food sovereignty  One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed food sovereignty‚Äîthe right of peoples to define their own food agriculture livestock and fisheries systems in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market Health facilities Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world These facilities could monitor undernourished children act as supplemental food distribution centers and provide education on dietary needs These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana Global initiatives In April 2012 the Food Assistance Convention was signed the worlds first legally binding international agreement on food aid The May 2012 Copenhagen Consensus recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending They put this ahead of other priorities like the fight against malaria and AIDS The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the Sustainable Development Goals In particular Goal 2 Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture The partnership Compact2025 led by IFPRI with the involvement of UN organisations NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidencebased advice to politicians and other decisionmakers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years by 2025 The EndingHunger campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world Another initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement SUN Started in 2010 this movement of people from governments civil society the United Nations donors businesses and researchers publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 55 partner countries Management    In response to child malnutrition the Bangladeshi government recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition They are to prevent or treat dehydration low blood sugar low body temperature infection correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies start feeding cautiously achieve catchup growth provide psychological support and prepare for discharge and followup after recovery Among those patients who are hospitalized nutritional support improves protein colorie intake and weight Food The evidence for benefit of supplementary feeding is poor This is due to the small amount of research done on this treatment Specially formulated foods do however appear useful in those from the developing world with moderate acute malnutrition In young children with severe acute malnutrition it is unclear if readytouse therapeutic food differs from a normal diet They may have some benefits in humanitarian emergencies as they can be eaten directly from the packet do not require refrigeration or mixing with clean water and can be stored for years In those who are severely malnourished feeding too much too quickly can result in refeeding syndrome This can result regardless of route of feeding and can present itself a couple of days after eating with heart failure dysrhythmias and confusion that can result in death Micronutrients Treating malnutrition mostly through fortifying foods with micronutrients vitamins and minerals improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of aid according to the World Bank The Copenhagen Consensus which look at a variety of development proposals ranked micronutrient supplements as number one In those with diarrhea once an initial fourhour rehydration period is completed zinc supplementation is recommended Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months In addition malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration and including foods rich in potassium as above Low blood potassium is worsened when base as in RingersHartmanns is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium As above available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a childs diarrhea along with continued eating Vitamin A potassium magnesium and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas green coconut water and unsweetened fresh fruit juice Diarrhea  The World Health Organization WHO recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called oral rehydration solution ORS The oral rehydration solution is both slightly sweet and slightly salty and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium Fluids by nasogastric tube may be use in those who do not drink Intravenous fluids are recommended only in those who have significant dehydration due to their potential complications These complications include congestive heart failure Over time ORS developed into ORT or oral rehydration therapy which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts carbohydrates and water This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea Breast feeding and eating should resume as soon as possible Drinks such as soft drinks fruit juices or sweetened teas are not recommended as they contain too much sugar and may worsen diarrhea Broad spectrum antibiotics are recommended in all severely undernourished children with diarrhea requiring admission to hospital To prevent dehydration readily available fluids preferably with a modest amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water may be used The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given unless there are signs of swelling If vomiting occurs fluids can be paused for 5‚Äì10 minutes and then restarting more slowly Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth for children under 2 a teaspoon every one to two minutes and for older children and adults frequent sips directly from a cup After the first two hours rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food In 2003 WHO and UNICEF recommended a reducedosmolarity ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting Reducedosmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability For general use one packet of ORS glucose sugar salt potassium chloride and trisodium citrate is added to one liter of water however for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water 34 oz and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 12 with perhaps most sources recommending 12 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water Low blood sugar Hypoglycemia whether known or suspected can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water If the child is conscious the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth If the child is unconscious give glucose by intravenous or nasogastric tube If seizures occur after despite glucose rectal diazepam is recommended Blood sugar levels should be rechecked on two hour intervals Hypothermia Hypothermia can occur To prevent or treat this the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skintoskin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided Warming methods are usually most important at night Economics There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper faster and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable The UNs World Food Program the biggest nongovernmental distributor of food announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas which Josette Sheeran the WFPs executive director described as a revolution in food aid The aid agency Concern Worldwide is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator Safaricom which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another However for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help Fred Cuny stated that the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people many will have died US law which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport Cuny further pointed out studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available incountry ‚Äî though not always in the immediate food deficit area and even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad Ethiopia has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Banks prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations Through the countrys main food assistance program the Productive Safety Net Program Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food a chance to work for food or cash Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food Ethiopia been pioneering a program and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers urban poor and the city in general City residents separate organic waste from their garbage bag it and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers As a result the countrys waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food Epidemiology    The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to undernutrition even if the term malnutrition is used which by definition could also apply to too much nutrition People affected There were 793 million undernourished people in the world in 2015 This was 216 million fewer people than in 1990 when it was 991 million undernourished people This is despite the worlds farmers producing enough food to feed around 12 billion people ‚Äì almost double the current world population Malnutrition as of 2010 was the cause of 14 of all disability adjusted life years Mortality  Mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58 percent of the total mortality in 2006 In the world approximately 62 million people all causes of death combined die each year One in twelve people worldwide is malnourished and according to the Save the Children 2012 report one in four of the world‚Äôs children are chronically malnourished In 2006 more than 36 million died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients In 2010 proteinenergy malnutrition resulted in 600000 deaths down from 883000 deaths in 1990 Other nutritional deficiencies which include iodine deficiency and iron deficiency anemia result in another 84000 deaths In 2010 malnutrition caused about 15 million deaths in women and children According to the World Health Organization malnutrition is the biggest contributor to child mortality present in half of all cases Six million children die of hunger every year Underweight births and intrauterine growth restrictions cause 22 million child deaths a year Poor or nonexistent breastfeeding causes another 14 million Other deficiencies such as lack of vitamin A or zinc for example account for 1 million Malnutrition in the first two years is irreversible Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement Their own children tend to be smaller Malnutrition was previously seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles pneumonia and diarrhea but malnutrition actually causes diseases and can be fatal in its own right Society and culture Roughly 300 million of aid goes to basic nutrition each year less than 2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries In contrast HIVAIDS which causes fewer deaths than child malnutrition received 22 billion‚Äî67 per person with HIV in all countries The International Crops Research Institute for the SemiArid Tropics ICRISAT a member of the CGIAR consortium partners with farmers governments researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops such as chickpea groundnut pigeonpea millet and sorghum This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in SubSaharan Africa and the IndianSubcontinent HOPE project for example is increasing yields of finger millet in Tanzania by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties Finger millet is very high in calcium rich in iron and fiber and has a better energy content than other cereals These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly Some organizations have begun working with teachers policymakers and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to universitylevel institutions Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success The verb form is malnourish malnourishment is sometimes used instead of malnutrition Special populations Undernutrition is an important determinant of maternal and child health accounting for more than a third of child deaths and more than 10 percent of the total global disease burden according to 2008 studies Children   The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide about 1 million children Another estimate also by WHO states that childhood underweight is the cause for about 35 of all deaths of children under the age of five years worldwide As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases the indirect disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the direct effects of malnutrition The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water sanitation and hygiene WASH practices is estimated to lead to 860000 deaths per year in children under five years of age Women Gender Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country These smallscale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in SouthSoutheast Asia and Latin America and were lower in SubSaharan Africa Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 15 and 2 times higher in men than in women however in India and Pakistan datasets rates of undernutrition were 152 times higher in women than in men Intracountry variation also occurs with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates Gender inequality in nutrition in some countries such as India is present in all stages of life Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men Gender discrimination gender roles and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing close birth spacing and undernutrition all of which contribute to malnourished mothers Within the household there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty lack of development and awareness and illiteracy The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a womans access to sufficient food and healthcare How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic In some cases such as in parts of Kenya in 2006 rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients however physical activity which largely determines energy requirements is difficult to estimate Physiology Women have unique nutritional requirements and in some cases need more nutrients than men for example women need twice as much calcium as men Pregnancy and breastfeeding During pregnancy and breastfeeding women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods as well as more vitamins and minerals especially iron iodine calcium folic acid and vitamins A C and K In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in developing countries and increased the risk of death during childbirth A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium iron and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105000 maternal deaths 236 percent of all maternal deaths Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden Educating children According to the FAO women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children Elderly  Malnutrition and being underweight are more common in the elderly than in adults of other ages If elderly people are healthy and active the aging process alone does not usually cause malnutrition However changes in body composition organ functions adequate energy intake and ability to eat or access food are associated with aging and may contribute to malnutrition Sadness or depression can play a role causing changes in appetite digestion energy level weight and wellbeing A study on the relationship between malnutrition and other conditions in the elderly found that malnutrition in the elderly can result from gastrointestinal and endocrine system disorders loss of taste and smell decreased appetite and inadequate dietary intake Poor dental health illfitting dentures or chewing and swallowing problems can make eating difficult As a result of these factors malnutrition is seen to develop more easily in the elderly Rates of malnutrition tend to increase with age with less than 10 percent of the young elderly up to age 75 malnourished while 30 to 65 percent of the elderly in home care longterm care facilities or acute hospitals are malnourished Many elderly people require assistance in eating which may contribute to malnutrition Because of this one of the main requirements of elderly care is to provide an adequate diet and all essential nutrients In Australia malnutrition or risk of malnutrition occurs in 80 percent of elderly people presented to hospitals for admission Malnutrition and weight loss can contribute to sarcopenia with loss of lean body mass and muscle function Abdominal obesity or weight loss coupled with sarcopenia lead to immobility skeletal disorders insulin resistance hypertension atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders A paper from the Journal of the American Dietetic Association noted that routine nutrition screenings represent one way to detect and therefore decrease the prevalence of malnutrition in the elderly See also  Agrobiodiversity Hunger Eating disorder Community Therapeutic Care NutritionDay

Growing Growing microgreens is relatively easy many small backyard growers have sprung up selling their greens at farmers markets or to restaurants A shallow plastic container with drainage holes such as a nursery flat or prepackagedsalad box will facilitate sprouting and grow out on a small scale Growing and marketing highquality microgreens commercially is much more difficult Nutritional analysis  Researchers at the USDA Agricultural Research Service have published as of early 2014 several studies that identify the nutritional makeup and the shelf life of microgreens Twentyfive varieties were tested key nutrients measured were ascorbic acid vitamin C tocopherols vitamin E phylloquinone vitamin K and betacarotene a vitamin A precursor plus other related carotenoids in the cotyledons  Among the 25 microgreens tested red cabbage cilantro garnet amaranth and green daikon radish had the highest concentrations of vitamin C carotenoids vitamin K and vitamin E respectively In general microgreens contained considerably higher levels of vitamins and carotenoids‚Äîabout five times greater‚Äîthan their mature plant counterparts an indication that microgreens may be worth the trouble of delivering them fresh during their short lives  A nutritional study of microgreens was done in the summer of 2012 by the Department of Nutrition and Food Science University of Maryland indicating promising potential that microgreens may indeed have particularly high nutritional value compared to mature vegetables Bhimu Patil a professor of horticulture and director of the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas AampM University agrees that microgreens may potentially have higher levels of nutrients than mature vegetables But he says more studies are needed to compare the two side by side This is a very good start but there can be a lot of variation in nutrients depending on where you grow it when you harvest and the soil medium Patil says When choosing a microgreen researchers say to look for the most intensely colored ones which will be the most nutritious Results of the microgreens research project conducted by the University of Maryland and the USDA has garnered attention from several national media outlets including National Public Radio NPR and The Huffington Post Microgreens sprout comparison Sprouts are germinated or partially germinated seeds A sprout consists of the seed root stem while microgreens are harvested without the roots Microgreens have stronger flavors compared to sprouts and come in a wide selection of leaf shapes textures and colors Microgreens are grown in soil or soillike materials such as peat moss Microgreens require high light levels preferably natural sunlight with low humidity and good air circulation Microgreens are planted with very low seed density compared to sprout processing Crop times are generally one to two weeks for most varieties though some can take four to six weeks Microgreens are ready to harvest when the leaves are fully expanded Harvesting is usually with scissors cutting just above the soil surface excluding any roots Some growers sell them while still growing rooted in the growing trays so that they can be cut later Once removed from their growing environment these trays of microgreens must be used quickly or they will rapidly begin to elongate and lose color and flavor Sprout seeds are soaked in water for usually eight hours and then drained A high density of seed is placed inside of sprouting equipment or enclosed containers The seed germinates rapidly due to the high moisture and humidity levels maintained in the enclosures Seeds can also be sprouted in cloth bags that are repeatedly soaked in water The sprouting process occurs in dark or very low light conditions These dark wet crowded conditions are ideal for the rapid proliferation of dangerous pathogenic bacteria After a few days of soaking and repeated rinsing in water several times a day to minimize spoilage the processing is complete and the sprouts are ready to consume The conditions that are ideal for properly grown microgreens do not encourage the growth of dangerous pathogens These growing methods would not work for the production of sprouts However the potential for food safety issues with microgreens may be increasing due to the number of indoor microgreen growing operations in which excessive seed density low light intensity low air circulation or most commonly a lack of GAP good agricultural practices and GMP good manufacturing practices based food safety procedures Certain provisions of the Guidance for Industry Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards For Sprouted Seeds  may be beneficial and prudent for growers of microgreens to follow Storage and commercial transport Microgreens have a short shelf life and better methods of storing and transporting microgreens are currently being studied which at this time are mainly focusing on buckwheat Commercial microgreens are most often stored in plastic clamshell containers which do not provide the right balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide for any live greens to breathe Among package materials called films differences in permeability see Permeation are referred to as the oxygen transmission rate The ARS researchers found that buckwheat microgreens packaged in films with an oxygen transmission rate of 225 cubic centimeters per square inch per day had a fresher appearance and better cell membrane integrity than those packaged in other films tested Following these steps the team maintained acceptable buckwheat microgreen quality for more than 14 days‚Äîa significant extension according to authors This study was published in LWTFood Science and Technology in 2013 Lightemitting diodes otherwise known as LEDs now provide the ability to measure impacts of narrowband wavelengths of light on seedling physiology The carotenoid zeaxanthin has been hypothesized to be a blue light receptor in plant physiology A study was carried out to measure the impact of shortduration blue light on phytochemical compounds which impart the nutritional quality of sprouting broccoli microgreens Broccoli microgreens were grown in a controlled environment under LEDs using growing pads Shortduration blue light acted to increase important phytochemical compounds influencing the nutritional value of broccoli microgreens References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Micronutrients are nutrients required by organisms throughout life in small quantities to orchestrate a range of physiological functions For people they include dietary trace minerals in amounts generally less than 100 milligrams per day as opposed to macrominerals which are required in larger quantities The microminerals or trace elements include at least iron cobalt chromium copper iodine manganese selenium zinc and molybdenum Micronutrients also include vitamins which are organic compounds required as nutrients in trace amounts    Public health initiatives for humans At the 1990 World Summit for Children the gathered nations identified deficiencies in two microminerals and one micronutrient ‚Äì iodine iron and vitamin A ‚Äì as being particularly common and posing public health risks in developing countries The Summit set goals for elimination of these deficiencies The Ottawabased Micronutrient Initiative was formed in response to this challenge with the mission to undertake research and fund and implement micronutrient programming As programming around these micronutrients grew new research in the 1990s led to the implementation of folate and zinc supplementation programmes as well Priority programs include supplementation with vitamin A for children 6‚Äì59 months zinc supplementation as a treatment for diarrhoeal disease iron and folate supplementation for women of childbearing age salt iodization staple food fortification multiple micronutrient powders biofortification of crops and behaviourcentred nutrition education Salt iodization Salt iodization is the recommended strategy for ensuring adequate human iodine intake To iodize salt potassium iodate is added to salt after it is refined and dried and before it is packed Although largescale iodization is most efficient given the proliferation of small scale salt producers in developing countries technology for smallscale iodization has also been developed International organizations work with national governments to identify and support small salt producers in adopting iodization activity In 1990 less than 20 percent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt By 1994 international partnerships had formed in a global campaign for Universal Salt Iodization By 2008 it was estimated that 72 per cent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt and the number of countries in which iodine deficiency disorders were a public health concern reduced by more than half from 110 to 47 countries Vitamin A supplementation In 1997 national vitamin A supplementation programming received a boost when experts met to discuss rapid scaleup of supplementation activity and the Micronutrient Initiative with support from the Government of Canada began to ensure vitamin A supply to UNICEF In areas with vitamin A deficiency it is recommended that children aged 6‚Äì59 months receive two doses annually In many countries vitamin A supplementation is combined with immunization and campaignstyle health events Global vitamin A supplementation efforts have targeted 103 priority countries In 1999 16 per cent of children in these countries received two annual doses of vitamin A By 2007 the rate increased to 62 per cent The Micronutrient Initiative with funding from the Government of Canada supplies 75 per cent of the vitamin A required for supplementation in developing countries Doublefortified salt Doublefortified salt DFS is a public health tool for delivering nutritional iron DFS is fortified with both iodine and iron It was developed by Venkatesh Mannar Executive Director of the Micronutrient Initiative and University of Toronto Professor Levente Diosady who discovered a process for coating iron particles with a vegetable fat to prevent the negative interaction of iodine and iron In India Tata Salt Plus priced at an economical rate of Rs 20 per kg is an iodine plus iron fortified salt developed by the National Institute of Nutrition Hyderabad through double fortification technology This technology was offered to Tata Chemicals under a longterm MoU after due studies on bioavailability across the population strata conducted and published by NIN It was first used in public programming in 2004 In September 2010 DFS was produced in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu and distributed through a state school feeding program DFS has also been used to combat Iron Deficiency Anemia IDA in the Indian state of Bihar In September 2010 Venkatesh Mannar was named a Laureat of the Californiabased Tech Awards for his work in developing DoubleFortified Salt Microenriched fertilization The returns of applying micronutrientenriched fertilizers could be huge for human health social and economic development Research has shown that enriching fertilizers with micronutrients had not only an impact on plant deficiencies but also on humans and animals through the food chain A 1994 report by the World Bank estimated that micronutrient malnutrition costs developing economies at least 5 percent of gross domestic product The Asian Development Bank has summarized the benefits of eliminating micronutrient deficiencies as follows  Along with a growing understanding of the extent and impact of micronutrient malnutrition several interventions have demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of correction and prevention Distributing inexpensive capsules diversifying to include more micronutrientrich foods or fortifying commonly consumed foods can make an enormous difference Correcting iodine vitamin A and iron deficiencies can improve the populationwide intelligence quotient by 1015 points reduce maternal deaths by one fourth decrease infant and child mortality by 40 percent and increase people‚Äôs work capacity by almost half The elimination of these deficiencies will reduce health care and education costs improve work capacity and productivity and accelerate equitable economic growth and national development Improved nutrition is essential to sustained economic growth Micronutrient deficiency elimination is as cost effective as the best public health interventions and fortification is the most costeffective strategy  Addressing zinc deficiencies through zinc fertilization Experiments show that soil and foliar application of zinc fertilizer can effectively reduce the phytate zinc ratio in grain People who eat bread prepared from zinc enriched wheat show a significant increase in serum zinc suggesting that the zinc fertilizer strategy is a promising approach to address zinc deficiencies in humans Where zinc deficiency is a limiting factor zinc fertilization can increase crop yields Balanced crop nutrition supplying all essential nutrients including zinc is a cost effective management strategy Even with zincefficient varieties zinc fertilizers are needed when the available zinc in the topsoil becomes depleted Micronutrients for plants  There are about seven nutrients essential to plant growth and health that are only needed in very small quantities Though these are present in only small quantities they are all necessary Boron is believed to be involved in carbohydrate transport in plants it also assists in metabolic regulation Boron deficiency will often result in bud dieback Chlorine is necessary for osmosis and ionic balance it also plays a role in photosynthesis Copper is a component of some enzymes Symptoms of copper deficiency include browning of leaf tips and chlorosis Iron is essential for chlorophyll synthesis which is why an iron deficiency results in chlorosis Manganese activates some important enzymes involved in chlorophyll formation Manganese deficient plants will develop chlorosis between the veins of its leaves The availability of manganese is partially dependent on soil pH Molybdenum is essential to plant health Molybdenum is used by plants to reduce nitrates into usable forms Some plants use it for nitrogen fixation thus it may need to be added to some soils before seeding legumes Zinc participates in chlorophyll formation and also activates many enzymes Symptoms of zinc deficiency include chlorosis and stunted growth Micronutrient deficiencies in crops Micronutrient deficiencies are widespread 51 of world cereal soils are deficient in zinc and 30 of cultivated soils globally are deficient in iron Steady growth of crop yields during recent decades in particular through the Green Revolution compounded the problem by progressively depleting soil micronutrient pools In general farmers only apply micronutrients when crops show deficiency symptoms while micronutrient deficiencies decrease yields before symptoms appear Some common farming practices such as liming acid soils contribute to widespread occurrence of micronutrient deficiencies in crops by decreasing the availability of the micronutrients present in the soil Also extensive use of glyphosate is increasingly suspected to impair micronutrient uptake by crops especially with regard to manganese iron and zinc See also  List of micronutrients Macronutrient ecology Dietary mineral Manganese

Nesfatin1 influences the excitability of a large proportion of different subpopulations of neurons located in the PVN It is also reported that magnocellular oxytocin neurons are activated during feeding and ICV infusion of oxytocin antagonist increases food intake indicating a possible role of oxytocin in the regulation of feeding behavior In addition it is proposed that feedingactivated nesfatin1 neurons in the PVN and SON could play an important role in the postprandial regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis Nesfatin1 immunopositive neurons are also located in the arcuate nucleus ARC Nesfatin1 immunoreactive neurons in the ARC are activated by simultaneous injection of ghrelin and desacyl ghrelin nesfatin1 may be involved in the desacyl ghrelininduced inhibition of the orexigenic effect of peripherally administered ghrelin in freely fed rat Nesfatin1 was coexpressed with melanin concentrating hormone MCH in tuberal hypothalamic neurons Nesfatin1 coexpressed in MCH neurons may play a complex role not only in the regulation of food intake but also in other essential integrative brain functions involving MCH signaling ranging from autonomic regulation stress mood cognition to sleep Metabolism There is growing evidence that nesfatin1 may play an important role in the regulation of food intake and glucose homeostasis For instance continuous infusion of nesfatin1 into the third brain ventricle significantly decreased food intake and body weight gain in rats In previous studies we have also shown that plasma nesfatin1 levels were elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM and associated with BMI plasma insulin and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance It was found that central nesfatin1 resulted in a marked suppression of hepatic PEPCK mRNA and protein levels in both standard diet SD and high fat diet HFD rats but failed to alter glucose 6phosphatase G6Pase activity and protein expression Central nesfatin1 appeared to antagonize the effect of HFD on increasing PEPCK gene expression in vivo In agreement with decreasing PEPCK gene expression central nesfatin1 also resulted in a reduced PEPCK enzyme activity further confirming that it affected PEPCK rather than G6Pase The part of the glucose entering the liver is phosphorylated by glucokinase and then dephosphorylated by G6Pase This futile cycle between glucokinase and G6Pase is named glucose cycling and it accounts for the difference between the total flux through G6Pase and glucose production G6Pase catalyzes the last step in both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis and PEPCK is responsible only for gluconeogenesis In this study central nesfatin1 led to a marked suppression of hepatic PEPCK protein and activity but failed to alter hepatic G6Pase activity suggesting that PEPCK may be more sensitive to shortterm central nesfatin1 exposure than G6Pase In addition we also considered that the suppression of HGP by central nesfatin1 was dependent on an inhibition of the substrate flux through G6Pase and not on a decrease in the amount of G6Pase enzyme Thus in SD and HFD rats central nesfatin1 may have decreased glucose production mainly via decreasing gluconeogenesis and PEPCK activity Recently it has been reported that ICV nesfatin1 produced a dosedependent delay of gastric emptying To further delineate the mechanism by which central nesfatin1 modulates glucose homeostasis we assessed the effects of central nesfatin1 on the phosphorylation of several proteins in the INSR ‚Üí IRS1 ‚Üí AMPK ‚Üí Akt signaling cascade in the liver We found that central nesfatin1 significantly augmented InsR and IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation These results demonstrated that central nesfatin1 in both SD and HFD rats resulted in a stimulation of liver insulin signaling that could account for the increased insulin sensitivity and improving glucose metabolism AMPK is a key regulator of both lipid and glucose metabolism It has been referred to as a metabolic master switch because its activity is regulated by the energy status of the cell In this study we demonstrate that central nesfatin1 resulted in increased phosphorylation of AMPK accompanied by a marked suppression of hepatic PEPCK activity mRNA and protein levels in both SD and HFD rats Notably central nesfatin1 appears to prevent the obesitydriven decrease in phosphoAMPK levels in HFDfed rats Because hepatic AMPK controls glucose homeostasis mainly through the inhibition of gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production the suppressive effect of central nesfatin1 on the HGP Hepatic Glucose Production can be attributed partly to its ability to suppress the expression of PEPCK mRNA and protein through AMPK activation Furthermore the activation of AMPK has been shown to enhance glucose uptake in skeletal muscle Therefore increased AMPK phosphorylation by central nesfatin1 may also have been responsible for the improved glucose uptake in muscle Akt is a key effector of insulininduced inhibition of HGP and stimulation of muscle glucose uptake We therefore examined the effects of central nesfatin1 on Akt phosphorylation in vivo We found that central nesfatin1 produced a pronounced increase in insulinmediated phosphorylation of Akt in the liver of HFDfed rats This increase was paralleled by an increase in muscle glucose uptake and inhibition of HGP This provided correlative evidence that Akt activation may be involved in nesfatin1 signaling and its effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity The mTOR pathway has emerged as a molecular mediator of insulin resistance which can be activated by both insulin and nutrients It is needed to fully activate AKT and consists of two discrete protein complexes TORC1 and TORC2 only one of which TORC1 binds rapamycin In addition to mTOR the TORC2 complex contains RICTOR mLST8 and SIN1 and regulates insulin action and Akt phosphorylation Thus mTOR sits at a critical juncture between insulin and nutrient signaling making it important both for insulin signaling downstream from Akt and for nutrient sensing Until now it has not been known whether nesfatin1 affects activation of mTOR To gain further insight into the mechanism underlying the insulinsensitizing effects of ICV nesfatin1 we assessed mTOR and TORC2 phosphorylation in liver samples of SD and HFDfed animals Both mTOR and TORC2 phosphorylations were increased in livers from these rats demonstrating activation of mTOR and TORC2 by central nesfatin1 in vivo As mTOR kinase activity is required for Akt phosphorylation the observed increased Akt phosphorylation may have been caused by the concomitant activation of the mTORTORC2 Thus its postulated that the mTORTORC2 plays a role as a negativefeedback mechanism in the regulation of metabolism and insulin sensitivity mediated by central nesfatin1 See also Diabetes Ghrelin Insulin Leptin

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutrient sensing is a cells ability to recognize and respond to fuel substrates such as glucose Each type of fuel used by the cell requires an alternate pathway of utilization and accessory molecules In order to conserve resources a cell will only produce molecules that it needs at the time The level and type of fuel that is available to a cell will determine the type of enzymes it needs to express from its genome for utilization Receptors on the cell membranes surface designed to be activated in the presence of specific fuel molecules communicate to the cell nucleus via a means of cascading interactions In this way the cell is aware of the available nutrients and is able to produce only the molecules specific to that nutrient type    Nutrient Sensing in Mammalian Cells A rapid and efficient response to disturbances in nutrient levels is crucial for the survival of organisms from bacteria to humans Cells have therefore evolved a host of molecular pathways that can sense nutrient concentrations and quickly regulate gene expression and protein modification to respond to any changes Cell growth is regulated by coordination of both extracellular nutrients and intracellular metabolite concentrations AMPactivated kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 serve as key molecules that sense cellular energy and nutrients levels respectively The interplay among nutrients metabolites gene expression and protein modification are involved in the coordination of cell growth with extracellular and intracellular conditions Living cells use ATP as the most important direct energy source Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate or AMP and pyrophosphate provides energy for most biological processes The ratio of ATP to ADP and AMP is a barometer of cellular energy status and is therefore tightly monitored by the cell In eukaryotic cells AMPactivated protein kinase AMPK serves as a key cellular energy sensor and a master regulator of metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis Regulation of Tissue Growth Through Nutrient Sensing Nutrient sensing is a key regulator of tissue growth The main mediator of cellular nutrient sensing is the protein kinase TOR target of rapamycin TOR receives information from levels of cellular amino acids and energy and it regulates the activity of processes involved in cell growth such as protein synthesis and autophagy Insulinlike signaling is the main mechanism of systemic nutrient sensing and mediates its growthregulatory functions largely through the protein kinase pathway Other nutritionregulated hormonal mechanisms contribute to growth control of modulating the activity of insulinlike signaling Nutrient Sensing in Plants Higher plants require a number of essential nutrient elements for completing their life cycles Mineral nutrients are mainly acquired by roots from the rhizosphere and are subsequently distributed to shoots To cope with nutrient limitations plants have evolved a set of elaborate responses consisting of sensing mechanisms and signaling processes to perceive and adapt to external nutrient availability Plants obtain most necessary nutrients by taking them up from the soil into their roots Although plants cannot move to a new environment when nutrient availability is less than favorable they can modify their development to favor root colonization of soil areas where nutrients are abundant Therefore plants perceive the availability of external nutrients like nitrogen and couple this nutrient sensing to an appropriate adaptive response Types of Nutrients in Plants Potassium and phosphorus are important macronutrients for crops but are often deficient in the field Very little is known about how plants sense fluctuations in K and P and how information about K and P availability is integrated at the whole plant level into physiological and metabolic adaptations Smaller amounts of other micronutrients are also important for the growth of the crop All of these nutrients are equally important for the growth of the plant and lack of one nutrient can result in poor growth of the plant as well as becoming more vulnerable to diseases or can lead to death These nutrients along with CO2 and energy from the sun aids in the development of the plant Nitrogen Sensing As one of the most vital nutrients for the development and growth of all plants nitrogen sensing and the signalling response are vital for plants to live Plants absorb nitrogen through the soil in the form of either nitrate or ammonia In soil with low oxygen levels ammonia is the primary nitrogen source but toxicity is carefully controlled for with the transcription of ammonium transporters AMTs This metabolite and others including glutamate and glutamine have been shown to act as a signal of low nitrogen through regulation of nitrogen transporter gene transcription NRT11 also known as CHL1 is the nitrate transceptor transporter and receptor found on the plasma membrane of plants This is both a high and low affinity transceptor that senses varying concentrations of nitrate depending on its T101 residue phosphorylation It has been shown that nitrate can also act as just a signal for plants since mutants unable to metabolize are still able to sense the ion For example many plants show the increase of nitrateregulated genes in low nitrate conditions and consistent mRNA transcription of such genes in soil high in nitrate This demonstrates the ability to sense nitrate soil concentrations without metabolic products of nitrate and still exhibit downstream genetic effects Potassium Sensing Potassium K one of the essential macronutrients is found in plant soil K is the most abundant cation and it is very limited in plant soil Plants absorb K from the soil through channels that are found at the plasma membrane of root cells Potassium is not assimilated into organic matter like other nutrients such as nitrate and ammonium but serves as a major osmoticum Brain and Gut Regulation of Food Intake Maintaining a careful balance between stored energy and caloric intake is important to ensure that the body has enough energy to maintain itself

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutriepigenomics is the study of food nutrients and their effects on human health through epigenetic modifications There is now considerable evidence that nutritional imbalances during gestation and lactation are linked to noncommunicable diseases such as obesity cardiovascular disease diabetes hypertension and cancer If metabolic disturbances occur during critical time windows of development the resulting epigenetic alterations can lead to permanent changes in tissue and organ structure or function and predispose individuals to disease    Overview Epigenetics relates to heritable changes in gene function that occur independently of alterations in primary DNA sequence Two major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in nutriepigenomics are DNA methylation and histone modification DNA methylation in gene promoter regions usually results in gene silencing and influences gene expression While this form of gene silencing is extremely important in development and cellular differentiation aberrant DNA methylation can be detrimental and has been linked to various disease processes such as cancer The methyl groups used in DNA methylation are often derived from dietary sources such as folate and choline and explains why diet can have a significant impact on methylation patterns and gene expression Gene silencing can also be reinforced through the recruitment of histone deacetylases to decrease transcriptional activation Conversely histone acetylation induces transcriptional activation to increase gene expression Dietary components can influence these epigenetic events thereby altering gene expression and disturbing functions such as appetite control metabolic balance and fuel utilization Various genetic sequences can be targeted for epigenetic modification A transcriptomewide analysis in mice found that a proteinrestricted PR diet during gestation resulted in differential gene expression in approximately 1 of the fetal genes analyzed 23522690 Specifically increased expression was seen in genes involved in the p53 pathway apoptosis negative regulators of cell metabolism and genes related to epigenetic control Additional studies have investigated the effect of a PRdiet in rats and found changes in promoter methylation of both the glucocorticoid receptor and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor PPAR Altered expression of these receptors can result in elevated blood glucose levels and affect lipid and carbohydrate metabolism Feeding a PRdiet to pregnant andor lactating mice also increased expression of glucokinase acetylCoA carboxylase PPARŒ± and acylCoA oxidase Changes in expression were reportedly due to epigenetic regulation of either the gene promoter itself or promoters of transcription factors that regulate gene expression Additional genes that have been shown either by in vitro or in vivo studies to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms include leptin SOCS3 glucose transporter GLUT4 POMC 11Œ≤hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 and corticotrophin releasing hormone Epigenetic modification of these genes may lead to ‚Äúmetabolic programming‚Äù of the fetus and result in longterm changes in metabolism and energy homeostasis Nutriepigenomics and development The period of development in which the nutritional imbalance occurs is very important in determining which diseaserelated genes will be affected Different organs have critical developmental stages and the time point at which they are compromised will predispose individuals to specific diseases Epigenetic modifications that occur during development may not be expressed until later in life depending on the function of the gene While the majority of studies implicate prenatal and perinatal periods as critical time windows some research has shown that nutritional intake during adulthood can also affect the epigenome Prenatal Developmental plasticity is the process in which fetuses adapt to their environment Environmental cues including dietary components present in the in utero environment can induce significant changes in the expression of the genome through epigenetic modifications Fetal developmental plastic responses can cause changes in lean body mass endocrinology blood flow and vascular loading and lead to increased risk of various diseases in adulthood Low Birth Weight Fetal exposure to calcium folate magnesium high or low protein and zinc have all been associated with birth weight Numerous studies have investigated the link between birth weight and risk of disease and have found that low birth weight is significantly associated with coronary heart disease stroke and type2 diabetes Most importantly these associations occurred after adjusting for lifestyle factors implying a genetic basis for onset of disease Impaired insulin secretion is associated with low birth weight and can lead to insulin resistance as babies accumulate body fat Studies using intrauterine growth retarded IUGR rats have found that growth inhibition can lead to decreased expression of Pdx1 transcription factor which is essential for differentiation and function of pancreatic beta cells Decreased histone acetylation at the proximal promoter of Pdx1 is responsible for reduced Pdx1 expression and subsequently results in a cascade of histone deacetylation and methylation events that can result in type2 diabetes  Obesity Obesity during pregnancy and highfat maternal diets both show strong associations with obesity in offspring As the number of overweight reproductiveage women increases the number of overweight children and infants also increases It has been postulated that maternal obesity causes an accumulation of fat in fetal adipose tissue adiposity and predisposes babies for obesity in childhood and adulthood Animal studies have shown that maternal overnutrition may impact brain development and cause disruptions to programming of the hypothalamus Offspring that were exposed to a highfat or highcaloric maternal diet had increased levels of insulin glucose and leptin It is hypothesized that these elevations are due to disturbances in the complex neuronal network that includes the neuropeptide Y NPY and proopiomelanocortin POMC pathways This altered neuronal signaling can consequently impact foodintake behavior and lead to dietinduced obesity in adulthood While epigenetic modifications are most likely involved in the development of obesity the specific target genes have yet to be identified Genes involved in adipogenesis such as fibroblast growthfactor2 phosphatase and tensin homologue cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 1A and oestrogen receptoralpha possess multiple CpG islands in their promoter sites and may act as epigenetic targets Furthermore it has been shown that prenatal exposure to a hypomethylating agent such as bisphenol A BPA is associated with increased body weight and suggests modified DNA methylation as a mechanism for increasing susceptibility to obesity Folate It has long been realized that maternal folate intake during pregnancy is linked to fetal development and growth and can reduce the risk of serious birth defects Folate is a source of Sadenosyl methionine SAM which is used to supply DNA methyltransferases with methyl groups Therefore changes in folate supply have a substantial effect on DNA methylation patterns Low levels of folate are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery poor growth of the placenta and uterus and intrauterine growth retardation Several complex diseases including cancer cardiovascular diseases and autism have also been linked to maternal folate status Based on animal studies it has been hypothesized that reduced folate intake could increase the risk of neural tube defects by reducing the amount of methylayed DNA during cranial neural tube closure Recently it was discovered that folate protection from congenital heart defects is linked to epigenetics and Wnt signaling Multiple environmental factors target the Wnt signaling pathway during embryogenesis and can cause misregulation of the pathway Folic acid metabolism generates SAM thereby altering the methylation states of histones H3K9 H3K4 and H3K27 and genetically altering Wnt signaling Recently a doubleblind placebo controlled trial of high dose Folinic Acid Leucovorin Calcium demonstrated efficacy at improving verbal communication in children with autism Perinatal Another critical developmental time window is the perinatal period the time period immediately before and after birth It has been shown that maternal diet in late pregnancy and an infant‚Äôs diet in the beginning weeks can all have significant impacts on gene expression Therefore perinatal nutrition is both latestage in utero nutrition and lactation Bone health Bone mass and the development of osteoporosis have been studied in relation to perinatal nutrition An important factor to consider when investigating perinatal nutrition is whether the baby was breastfed or formulafed Studies have shown that breastfed babies have increased bone mass compared to those were not breastfed and that this small increase in bone mass during a period of critical development could potentially program the skeleton to continue along a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù growth trajectory It has also been shown that maternal vitamin D insufficiency during late pregnancy is associated with reduced bone size and mineral mass in late childhood Peak bone mass has shown to be a good predictor of risk of fracture and osteoporosis with even a small increase in peak bone mass resulting in a much lower risk of bone fracture Research shows that genetic markers explain only a small proportion of variation in bone mass and risk of fracture Therefore healthy bone programming is most likely influenced by various epigenetic mechanisms such as imprinting of the growth promoting genes IGF2 or changes to the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis HPA Neurodevelopment Imbalances in maternal nutrition can also have a significant effect on fetal neurodevelopment Brain development occurs most rapidly during fetal development and infancy and research has shown that exposure to certain environmental conditions can have longlasting effects on cognition Specifically n3 fatty acids iodine iron and choline have been shown to influence brain development and impact cognitive ability and behavior The greatest evidence for a link between nutrition and neurodevelopment comes from studies that show low birth weight associated with low IQ and increased risk of schizophrenia Several studies suggest that breastfeeding promotes longterm neurodevelopment by providing the nutrients necessary for proper brain development A study in mice showed that cholinedeficient diets during the late gestation period impaired fetal brain development including decreased cell proliferation and reduced visualspatial and auditory memory These cognitive changes appeared to be due to altered histone and DNA methylation patterns in the fetal hippocampus thus providing a link between maternal nutrition epigenetics and early brain development Type1 diabetes It has been postulated that breastfeeding may also protect against type1 diabetes with research showing that formulafed infants are at an increased risk of developing islet autoantibodies Individuals with type1 diabetes experience a preclinical diabetes phase characterized by autoimmunity against pancreatic islets The introduction of certain foods in the first few months of life such as berries and cereal is significantly associated with increased risk of islet autoantibody development compared to babies who are exposed to solid foods later in life While the pathogenesis behind development of autoantibodies remains largely unknown it is very probable that an epigenetic link exists between perinatal diet and risk of type1 diabetes Adulthood The majority of research in nutriepigenomics has focused on nutritional imbalances during gestation and lactation periods However foods that are consumed during adulthood can also impact gene expression and disease pathogenesis Cancer is the disease most commonly associated with adult nutrition and epigenetic modifications DNA hypomethelation promotes cancer progression by allowing increased gene transcription while hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes and further promote uncontrolled cell division and tumor formation Compounds found in foods such as genistein and tea polyphenols are able to regulate DNA methyltransferases and histone acetylation in cultured cancer cells and may provide protection against certain types of cancer Other dietary compounds such as diallyl disulfide present in garlic and sulforaphane present in cruciferous vegetables have been associated with cancer prevention in clinical trials This may be due to their ability to inhibit histone deacetylase HDAC enzymes and prevent silencing of important regulatory genes Transgenerational effects  Many believe epigenetic regulation is cleared during the fertilization process yet more evidence for transgenerational effects TGEs are being revealed These TGEs take place when the epigenetic regulatory patterns are not sufficiently erased during fertilization possibly due to nutrition levels in previous generations Later generations may be affected from caloric and protein restriction highfat interventions and endocrine disruption in earlier generations Differences within the nutritional behavior of the maternal rat are believed to cause malprogramming in the F1 generation and may then be passed to subsequent generations Maternal rats fed a PRdiet during the entire length of pregnancy led to metabolicrelated problems in the F1 and F2 generations even with normal nutrition during the F1 pregnancy These effects have also been seen in the F3 generation depending on the length of protein restriction If protein restriction occurred solely during pregnancy the F1 and F2 offspring had higher systolic blood pressure and lower nephron numbers possibly predisposing them to hypertension Altered glucose utilization was detected in the grandoffspring of maternal rats fed a PRdiet during pregnancy and lactation potentially resulting in diabetes later on in life   Proteinrestriction in the F0 generation led to hypomethylation of promoters involved in metabolism in the F1 and F2 generations even though the F1 pregnant rat was given a normal diet The exact mechanism of this situation has yet to be elucidated however direct transmission is a distinct possibility meaning the epigenetic marks were preserved during spermatogenesis and oogenesis when they are normally erased Models used in nutriepigenomic studies Most research to date use common rodent models to investigate the role of nutrition on phenotype Popular areas to investigate include IUGR studies whereby rodents and sometimes sheep are subjected to a variety of nutritional conditions A model for studying IUGR in rodent was developed by Simmons et al 2010 and is used to investigate type II diabetes The maternal rats have their uterine arteries ligated causing altered use of glucose and insulin in the fetus and can therefore serve as a model for diabetes These growthretarded rats were found to be highly similar to human fetuses as they both display symptoms such as lowered glucose and insulin levels Gestational diabetes may also be studied through chemical induction using streptozotocin treatment of the pregnant rats Streptozotocin can cause destruction of the beta cells within the pancreas depending on the concentration given The predominant means of investigating nutriepigenetics involves varying the nutritional conditions to which a subject is exposed to and monitoring the effects thereafter Restricting caloric and protein intake are the two most common methods A pregnant rodent may have their caloric intake reduced up to 3050 of normal intake Protein restricted rodents are given 89 casein as opposed to control rats that are fed 20 casein Micronutrients such as zinc and iron may also be restricted to investigate the effects on offspring Additionally rats fed diets lacking or including methyl donors are often used to study the effects of diet on epigenomics as variations within the methylation of DNA are common means of silencing or expressing genes Supplementing maternal mice with folic acid vitamin B12 choline and betaine leads to increased levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites and causes a coat color change This is an example of epigenetically modifiable loci called a ‚Äúmetastable epiallele‚Äù of which only a few have been identified The above is an example of the ‚Äúagouti‚Äù gene locus whereby the insertion of a transposable element upstream to the Agouti gene is hypermethylated from the supplementation and causes a change in the mices coat color Diets containing higher carbohydrate and fat content attempt to mimic typical Westernstyle diets may also be used in nutriepigenetic studies Another method used is ‚Äúcatchup‚Äù where offspring of rats born to mothers subjected to various diets are subsequently crossfostered to mothers fed normal diets Future directions The possibilities of utilizing nutriepigenomics for intervention are quite expansive This can include preventative therapies such as providing an optimal regime for nutrition during pregnancy and lactation It is already common place for pregnant mothers to supplement their diets with choline and folate to prevent the development of neurological disabilities in the fetus  A highly specific diet termed an EpiG diet may be employed for an individual believed to be at higher risk of developing a metabolic disorder These diets may include supplementation with methyl donors such as folate There are also many other natural compounds such as resveratrol curcumin and green tea that have been termed ‚Äúepigenetic modifiers‚Äù as they have anticancer capabilities in addition to being used as treatments for metabolic diseases However the functions of these compounds still require longterm studies to evaluate their effect over time There also exists potential for therapeutic treatments that may correct metabolic disorders such as type II diabetes Components of garlic and cruciferous vegetables are known to possess HDAC inhibitors that modify the acetylation of histone proteins and may contain a protection against cancer These same compounds have also been implicated in irritable bowel syndrome IBS and colon cancer as they may modify the histones normally implicated in these diseases Elucidation of disease pathways is another future direction for nutriepigenomic studies For example cholinedeficient diets and alcohol metabolism during pregnancy may have very similar metabolic pathways Therefore animal studies using cholinerestricted diets may assist in investigations of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders When compared to studies of maternal transmission investigations into the role of paternal diets are lacking A review demonstrated the nutrition of both parents do in fact play a role in determining the health of their offspring A germline study reported paternal rats fed a highfat diet led to insulin dysfunction in the F1 offspring While this likely occurs via epigenetic modifications similar to those postulated in the maternal diets the exact mechanism remains to be defined Assessing the role of epigenetic mechanisms may be easier using paternal inheritance as sperm transmits epigenetic and genetic information whereas the female cells also transmit mitochondrial DNA See also

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutrigenomics is a branch of nutritional genomics and is the study of the effects of foods and food constituents on gene expression This means that nutrigenomics is research focusing on identifying and understanding molecularlevel interaction between nutrients and other dietary bioactives with the genome Nutrigenomics has also been described by the influence of genetic variation on nutrition by correlating gene expression or SNPs with a nutrients absorption metabolism elimination or biological effects By doing so nutrigenomics aims to enhance rational means to optimise nutrition with respect to the subjects genotype By determining the mechanism of the effects of nutrients or the effects of a nutritional regime nutrigenomics tries to define the causality or relationship between these specific nutrients and specific nutrient regimes diets on human health Nutrigenomics has been associated with the idea of personalized nutrition based on genotype While there is hope that nutrigenomics will ultimately enable such personalised dietary advice it is a science still in its infancy and its contribution to public health over the next decade is thought to be major Whilst nutrigenomics is aimed at developing an understanding of how the whole body responds to a food via systems biology research into the effect of a single genesingle food compound relationships is known as nutrigenetics    Definitions In a Nature Reviews Genetics paper nutrigenomics is defined an emerging field of research that expands upon the existing field of nutritional science using genomic based data\\xa0\\xa0Certain advances in the field such as\\xa0microarrays and\\xa0high throughput sequencing\\xa0allow for expansive analysis of the genome and invivo experiments in\\xa0knockout mice\\xa0are major sources of genomic based data This type of genomic data collection can be applied to view the effects that certain nutrients or foods may have on large portions or different locales of the genome rather than one specific location Nutrigenomics is also defined as a field that examines effect of nutrients on genome proteome metabolome and explains the relationship between these specific nutrients and nutrientregimes on human health In other words a nutrigenomics approach is a holistic one that examines the effect of nutrients at all levels from gene expression to metabolic pathways Background and preventive health Nutritional science originally emerged as a field that studied individuals lacking certain nutrients and the subsequent effects such as the disease\\xa0scurvy\\xa0which results from a lack of vitamin C As other diseases closely related to dietbut not deficiency such as Obesity became more prevalent nutritional science expanded to cover these topics as well\\xa0\\xa0Nutritional research typically focuses on preventative measure trying to identify what nutrients or foods will raise or lower risks of diseases and damage to the human body Nutrigenomics emerged as a possible way to fix gaps in the current field of nutritional science The development of technology to analyze the genome such as different types of sequencing and different microarrays suggest a new way to reinforce current theories or hypotheses Existing information from genetic research directs emerging research in nutrigenomics Individuals within the same population or even the same family have\\xa0genetic variability\\xa0There is a lack of consistent relationships between certain foods and nutrients and increased disease risk most likely due to this type of variation\\xa0\\xa0Nutrigenomics is highly personalized because it looks at biomarkers within each individual\\xa0One group of researchers suggest that current technology can be used to build an ideal dietintake of certain nutrients or a nutriome\\xa0A nutriome would ensure proper function of all pathways involved in genome maintenance Research has already provided evidence identifying potential genetic origins of metabolic disorders or compromised phenotypes\\xa0Disorders that scientists previously thought to be heritable can be identified as genetic disorders with set pathological effects\\xa0For example PraderWilli syndrome a disease whose most distinguishing factor is insatiable appetite has been specifically linked to an epigenetic pattern in which the paternal copy in the chromosomal region is erroneously deleted and the maternal loci is inactivated by over methylation\\xa0Yet although certain disorders may be linked to certain\\xa0single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs\\xa0or other localized patterns variation within a population may yield many more polymorphisms\\xa0Each may have a negligible effect by itself yet the cumulative effects may be significantNow with advances that have been made these small changes and additive effects are possible to study\\xa0\\xa0Small epigenetic changes such as methylation patterns or phosphorylation can be determined Rationale and aims Cell signaling is an important component of regulation of gene expression and metabolism relying on both internal and external signals to ensure the body is maintaining homeostasis Individual nutrients can each be considered signals with the summation of their effects being the diet\\xa0The effort of nutrigenomics is to identify this dietary signature or pattern of effects ranging from effects at the cellular level to entire body systems\\xa0However it is often hard to monitor the diet of an individual and current protocols should be improved The desired outcome from this type of research is to identify genetic factors for chronic diseases and conditions whether it be a certain gene itself or an epigenetic marker and how foods influence it Nutrigenomics looks mainly to be a way of identifying individuals predisposed for conditions and preventing onset\\xa0\\xa0First genes with regulation influenced must be identified and then more focused studies may emerge In addition nutrigenomics also looks to identify certain compounds that are\\xa0bioactive and other foods that are of particular benefit to health\\xa0This knowledge can be personalized to produce specific diet plans and functional foods to both prevent predisposed conditions and maximize health Application Antiaging Aging of cells occur because of the accumulation of excess free radicals formed due to the lack of proper nutrition to the cells and external factors like UV rays pollution stress food etc DNA analysis is instrumental in identifying the right concoction of nutrients needed to eliminate the excess free radicals present in the cell The science of nutrigenomics studies the interaction between dietary components of food and genes Scientific advances have now made it possible to apply nutrigenomics in the field of anti ageing and customize nutritional solutions in the form of supplements to meet the optimal nutrition required by the body to prevent aging of cells by the formation of excess free radicals Obesity Obesity is one of the most widely studied topics in nutrigenomics Due to genetic variations among individuals each person could respond to diet differently By exploring the interaction between dietary pattern and genetic factors nutrigenomics aim to suggest prevention measures and or treatment to obesity via personal nutrition There are studies suggesting genetic factors account for a fair proportion of interindividual BMI Body Mass Index Among different types of genetic variation between humans SNPs are suggested to be the most important marker for the study of nutrigenomics Multiple studies have found association between SNPs and obesity One of the most well known obesity associating gene is the FTO gene Among studied individuals it was found that those with AA genotype showed a higher BMI compared those with TT genotype when having high fat or low carbohydrate dietary intake The APO B SNP rs512535 is another obesity related variation It was found that the AG heterozygous genotype was found to have association with obesity in terms of BMI and waist circumference The same study also found that for individuals with habitual high fat diet gt35 of energy intaken individuals with GG homozygotes genotype showed higher BMI compared to AA allele carriers However this difference is not found in low fat consuming group lt35 of energy intaken Besides the FTO genes and APO B SNPs in various genes such as MC4R SH2B1 MTCH2 SEC16B etc have been found to be associated with obesity Although many of these genetic variations are found in populations all over the world there are also variations unique to certain races or populations Cancer Nutrigenomics may be able to supplement current\\xa0oncology There is a wealth of information about processes that occur within genome maintenance that prevent cell abnormalities linked to cancer and certain nutrients that play a role as cofactors\\xa0Genome damage caused by micronutrient deficiency may be just as severe as damage owed to exposure to certain environmental\\xa0carcinogens\\xa0If these micronutrients can be identified with concrete evidence the risk for cancer in some individuals could be significantly reduced One such micronutrient may be folate In one experiment\\xa0folate\\xa0was given to cells in different concentrations and those with less folate exhibited as much damage to their chromosomes as they would have exhibited with a heavy amount of radiation\\xa0 Nutrigenomics can be used to develop new alternative treatments that target the altered cancer cell metabolism\\xa0The alternative way of energy production in cancer cell metabolism the Warburg effect in which glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation are the main means of energy production opposed to oxidative reduction Certain nutrients may provide ways to starve or inhibit this type of metabolism\\xa0Polyunsaturated fatty acids\\xa0PUFA which affect gene expression related to inflammation and other nutrients that have displayed potential in repressing cancer cell metabolism\\xa0Another practical application of nutrigenomics to cancer may be identifying nutrient that is a cofactor of a compromised pathway where consuming a surplus of could potentially reduce the compromised pathway‚Äôs negative consequences\\xa0A nutrigenomics approach could provide a safe holistic model to mitigate tumor growth\\xa0in place of existing cancer treatments that often have harsh side effects and are not always effective Companies involved Companies across the Globe are currently involved in Nutrigenomics Solutions such as genetic diet plans and exercise schedule have helped sportsmen perform even better In India sportsmen like Sushil Kumar have taken advantage of Nutrigenomics Today even film stars have started following such plans In the movie Dangal Aamir Khan got his genes tested Across the globe there are companies who are not only working towards personalized nutrition but also personalized medicine Few companies like DNAfit in London 23andMe in the United States Genecorp in India and HiMyDna in HongKong Ethics To put nutrigenomics into practice genetic testing is required as the test results act as the reference for diagnosis Genetic testing has been met with many concerns surrounding ethics and regulations These concerns inherently become a part of if not augmented by Nutrigenomics a field that looks to provide highly personalized information Consent One of the major concerns regarding genetic tests would be privacy issue To perform any type of genetic testing consent is need directly by the individual who provides the sample However if an individual has results that indirectly tie family members to it by identifying information about a genetic predisposition or condition information about that family member has been inadvertently revealed\\xa0Thus this type of genetic testing would require consent from a network of individuals For some sets of the population such as mentally impaired adult or children it is not possible to obtain direct consentThe best interest of the patient must be determined by close family members care takers and professionals leaving room for discrepancy\\xa0Tissue samples obtained from patients particularly those who are deceased are also a source of controversy\\xa0There is no established ethical code to suggest if data from these patients should be allowed to be published or if they should remain only as sources of validation for lab techniques There also exists no regulation for releasing information about heritable condition to family members The stances on how to approach these situations are arbitrary and regulation provides few guidelines to direct them Distribution of tests As the subject is recently commercialized by companies which sell direct to customer DTC genetic tests as well as being applied by related professionals such as dietetic practitioners there has been increased awareness in the use of this information Validity Nutrigenomics is still a new field There are no set guidelines on how to interpret data from genetic testing Without a validated way to produce accurate results there exist concern about how valid results produced are The\\xa0Government Accountability Office\\xa0GAO attempted to check the validity of numerous DTC tests by sending out information and samples of sham identities\\xa0The information they received was varied and not medically verified and two companies tried to market general supplements as individualized\\xa0The GAO study was also rudimentary without taking into concern that differing environmental factors may affect results One suggestion to try and minimize fraud is to channel distribution of genetic testing to healthcare professionals\\xa0American College of Medical GeneticsACMG\\xa0has taken a stance that healthcare professionals should be involved for proper implementation of information from genetic testing\\xa0\\xa0Healthcare professionals are not necessarily qualified to properly interpret and distribute this information as it is not currently required that they have an indepth knowledge of genetics\\xa0There are a sheer 45 genetic residencies in the US with a low number of individuals who have completed training per year\\xa0\\xa0Practitioners often focus on acute medical conditions and do not spend much of their time making health recommendations to each patient\\xa0It is suggested that\\xa0nutritionists and\\xa0genetic counselors may be the best choice to ensure proper distribution of genetic tests results Privacy One of the major concerns regarding genetic tests would be privacy issue There are concerns on who has the right to have access to test results Abuse of these tests could result in discrimination For example genetic information might be used by insurance companies to risk rate their clients or assess how likely their clients are to be costly\\xa0Other examples of privacy concerns include disclosure to the workplace that may led to discrimination in employment\\xa0Social concerns

       "  'raw page text': 'Food is conventionally regarded as a means to provide energy and building material within the body Recently the ability of food to prevent and protect against diseases has started to become recognized mainly in relation to the effects of nutrients on molecular processes within the body Certain cells require particular nutrients to play specific roles in order to function properly and neurons are not exempt from this Relatively speaking the brain consumes an immense amount of energy in comparison to the rest of the body The mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function Human bodily processes including the brain all require both macronutrients as well as micronutrients Insufficient intake of selected vitamins or certain metabolic disorders may affect cognitive processes by disrupting the nutrientdependent processes within the body that are associated with the management of energy in neurons which can subsequently affect synaptic plasticity or the ability to encode new memories The prevalence of specific vitamin deficiencies has become rare in most industrialized countries with the introduction of vitamin fortification in flour cereals and other foods However in many African Asian and Latin American countries individuals must contend with a range of nutritionallysignificant diseases that continue to be major health problems within their respective populations    Nutrients needed for memory development Choline Choline is an essential nutrient and its primary function within the human body is the synthesis of cellular membranes although it serves other functions as well It is a precursor molecule to the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine which serves a wide range of functions including motor control and memory Choline itself has also been shown to have additional health benefits in relation to memory and choline deficiencies may be related to some liver and neurological disorders Because of its role in cellular synthesis choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain Deficiencies and treatments Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men women and children are below the Adequate Intake levels It is important to note that not enough choline is naturally produced by the body so diet is an important factor Women especially pregnant or lactating women older people and infants are especially at risk for choline deficiency In such instances of deficiency choline supplements or if able dietary changes may be beneficial Good sources of choline include liver milk eggs and peanuts BVitamin deficiencies and cognition  B vitamins also known as the Bcomplex are an interrelated group of nutrients which often cooccur in food The complex consists of thiamine B1 riboflavin B2 niacin B3 pantothenic acid B5 pyridoxin B6 folic acid B9 cobalamin B12 and biotin B vitamins are not synthesized in the body and thus need to be obtained from food Bcomplex vitamins are watersoluble vitamins which means that they are not stored within the body In consequence the B vitamins need ongoing replenishment It is possible to identify broad cognitive effects of certain B vitamins as they are involved in many significant metabolic processes within the brain Vitamin B1 thiamine Vitamin B1 also known as thiamine is a coenzyme essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates This vitamin is important for the facilitation of glucose use thus ensuring the production of energy for the brain and normal functioning of the nervous system muscles and heart Thiamine is found in all living tissues and is uniformly distributed throughout mammalian nervous tissue including the brain and spinal cord Metabolism and coenzyme function of the vitamin suggest a distinctive function for thiamin within the nervous system The brain retains its thiamine content in the face of a vitamindeficient diet with great tenacity as it is the last of all nervous tissues studied to become depleted A 50 reduction of thiamine stores in rats becomes apparent after only 4 days of being put on a thiaminedeficient diet However polyneuritic signs do not begin to appear until about 4 or 5 weeks have passed Similar results have been found in human subjects Deficiencies The body has only small stores of B1 accordingly there is risk of deficiency if the level of intake is reduced only for a few weeks Lack of thiamin causes the disease known as beriberi There are two forms of beriberi wet and dry Dry beriberi is also known as cerebral beriberi Characteristics of wet beriberi include prominent edema and cardiac involvement whereas dry beriberi is mainly characterized by a polyneuritis In industrialized nations thiamine deficiency is a clinically significant problem in individuals with chronic alcoholism or other disorders that interfere with normal ingestion of food Thiamine deficiency within developed nations tends to manifest as Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome Individuals with chronic alcoholism may fall short on minimum daily requirements of thiamine in part due to anorexia erratic eating habits lack of available food or a combination of any of these factors Thiamine deficiency has been reported in up to 80 of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake reduced absorption and impaired utilization of thiamine Alcohol in combination with its metabolite acetaldehyde interacts with thiamine utilization at the molecular level during transport diphosphorylation and modification processes For this reason chronic alcoholics may have insufficient thiamine for maintenance of normal brain function even with seemingly adequate dietary intake Symptoms Clinical signs of B1 deficiency include mental changes such as apathy decrease in shortterm memory confusion and irritability Moderate deficiency in thiamine may reduce growth in young populations in increase chronic illness in both young and middleaged adults In addition moderate deficiency of thiamine may increase rates of depression dementia falls and fractures in old age The lingering symptoms of neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi are known as Korsakoffs syndrome or the chronic phase of WernickeKorsakoffs Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder resulting from a deficiency in thiamine sharing the same predominant features of cerebral beriberi as characterized by ocular abnormalities ataxia of gait a global state of confusion and neuropathy The state of confusion associated with Wernickes may consist of apathy inattention spatial disorientation inability to concentrate and mental sluggishness or restlessness Clinical diagnosis of Wernickes disease cannot be made without evidence of ocular disturbance yet these criteria may be too rigid Korsakoffs likely represents a variation in the clinical manifestation of Wernicke encephalophathy as they both share similar pathological origin Korsakoffs syndrome is often characterized by confabulation disorientation and profound amnesia Characteristics of the neuropathology are varied but generally consist of bilaterally symmetrical midline lesions of brainstem areas including the mammillary bodies thalamus periaqueductal region hypothalamus and the cerebellar vermis Treatment Immediate treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy involves the administration of intravenous thiamine followed with longterm treatment and prevention of the disorder through oral thiamine supplements alcohol abstinence and a balanced diet Improvements in brain functioning of chronic alcoholics may occur with abstinencerelated treatment involving the discontinuation of alcohol consumption and improved nutrition Wernickes encephalopathy is lifethreatening if left untreated However a rapid reversal of symptoms may result from prompt administration of thiamine Prevention Fortification of flour is practiced in some countries to replace the thiamine lost during processing However this method has been criticized for missing the target population of chronic alcoholics who are most at risk for deficiency Alternative solutions have suggested the fortification of alcoholic beverages with thiamine Ingesting a diet rich in thiamine may stave off the adverse effects of deficiency Foods providing rich sources of thiamine include unrefined grain products readytoeat cereals meat especially pork dairy products peanuts legumes fruits and eggs Vitamin B3 niacin Vitamin B3 also known as niacin includes both nicotinamide as well as nicotinic acid both of which function in many biological oxidization and reduction reactions within the body These functions include the biochemical degradation of carbohydrates fats and proteins Niacin is also involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol which are known mediators of brain biochemistry and in effect of cognitive function Sufficient niacin intake is either obtained from diet or synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan Deficiencies  Severe niacin deficiency typically manifests itself as the disease pellagra Synthesis of B3 from tryptophan involves vitamin B2 and B6 so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to niacin deficiency An excess of leucine an essential amino acid in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B3 deficiency Pellagra is most common to populations within developing countries in which corn is the dietary staple The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa This is in part due to the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains which is not readily absorbed into the human body The processes involved in making corn tortillas can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake Though pellagra predominantly occurs in developing countries sporadic cases of pellagra may be observed within industrialized nations primarily in chronic alcoholics and patients living with functional absorption complications Symptoms Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 Ds diarrhea dermatitis dementia and death Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache irritability poor concentration anxiety hallucinations stupor apathy psychomotor unrest photophobia tremor ataxia spastic paresis fatigue and depression Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalophathy characterized by confusion memory loss and psychosis Those afflicted with pellagra may undergo pathological alterations in the nervous system Findings may include demylenation and degeneration of various affected parts of the brain spinal cord and peripheral nerves Treatment Prognosis of deficiency is excellent with treatment Without pellagra will gradually progress and lead to death within 4‚Äì5 years often a result of malnutrition from prolonged diarrhea or complications as caused by concurrent infections or neurological symptoms Symptoms of pellagra can be cured with exogenous administration of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide Flushing occurs in many patients treated therapeutically with nicotinic acid and as a result nicotinamide holds more clinical value as it is not associated with the same uncomfortable flushing The adult dose of nicotinamide is 100\\xa0mg taken orally every 6 hours until resolution of major acute symptoms followed with oral administration of 50\\xa0mg every 8‚Äì12 hours until skin lesions heal For children treatment involves oral ingestion of 10‚Äì15\\xa0mg of nicotinamide depending on weight every 6hours until signs and symptoms are resolved Severe cases require 1\\xa0gram every 3‚Äì4 hours administered parenterally Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an overthecounter drug for the treatment of Alzheimers dementia Conversely no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers vascular or frontotemporal types This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellegra but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia Prevention The best method of prevention is to eat food rich in B3 Generally this involves the intake of a proteinrich diet Foods that contain high concentrations of niacin in the free form include beans and organ meat as well as enriched grain and cereal products While niacin is present in corn and other grains the bioavailability of the nutrient is much less than it is in proteinrich sources Different methods of processing corn may result in a higher degree of bioavailability of the vitamin Though treatment with niacin does little to alter the effects of Alzheimers dementia niacin intake from foods is inversely associated with the disease Vitamin B9 folic acid Folic acid is the most oxidized and stable form of folate and can also be referred to as vitamin B9 It rarely occurs naturally in foods but it is the form used in vitamin supplements as well as fortified food products Folate coenzymes are involved in numerous conversion processes within the body including DNA synthesis and amino acid interconversions Folate and vitamin B12 play a vital role in the synthesis of Sadenosylmethionine which is of key importance in the maintenance and repairment of all cells including neurons In addition folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters Folate has a major but indirect role in activities which help to direct gene expression and cell proliferation These activities occur at a greatly increased rate during pregnancy and depend on adequate levels of folate within blood plasma Concentrations of blood plasma folate and homocysteine concentrations are inversely related such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration Thus dietary intake of folate is a major determinant of homocysteine levels within the body Deficiencies Folate deficiency most commonly arises from insufficient folate intake from the diet but may also stem from inefficient absorption or metabolic utilization of folate usually a result of genetic variation The relationship between folate and B12 is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in megaloblastic anemia characterized by organic mental change The process of neural tube transformation into structures that will eventually develop into the central nervous system is known as neurulation the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after conception and is completed by 28 days Thus a woman may not even be aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete potentially causing severe consequences in the development of the fetus Functional problems in the absorption and utilization of vitamins may also play a role in folate deficiencies within the elderly Symptoms  The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate and to a lesser extent vitamins B6 and B12 Elevated homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of vascular events as well as dementia Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B12 deficiency Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B12 generally results in peripheral neuropathy whereas folaterelated anemia often results in affective or mood disorders Neurological effects are not often associated with folaterelated megaloblastic anemia although demyelinating disorders may eventually present In one study mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B12 deficiency In addition folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups In addition depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard antidepressant therapy than did those with normal levels within plasma However replication of these findings are less robust The role of folic acid during pregnancy is vital to normal development of the nervous system in the fetus A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in neural tube disorder a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely NTDs are not to be confused with spina bifida which does not involve neural elements Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes encephalocele craniorachischisis and anencephaly In addition these defects can also be classified as open if neural tissue is exposed or covered only by membrane or can be classified as closed if the tissue is covered by normal skin Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in learning and memory particularly within the elderly population Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory Treatment Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin Indeed there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment In a 3year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50‚Äì70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800Œºg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma In addition to these results improvements of memory and informationprocessing speed as well as slight improvements of sensorimotor speed were observed which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance However while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels folate as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect Prevention Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400Œºg of folic acid from fortified foods supplements or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85 with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy The incidence of Alzheimers and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food fortified or not and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease Good sources of folate include liver readytoeat breakfast cereals beans asparagus spinach broccoli and orange juice Vitamin B12 cobalamin Also known as cobalamin B12 is an essential vitamin necessary for normal blood formation It is also important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health The absorption of B12 into the body requires adequate amounts of intrinsic factor the glycoprotein produced in the parietal cells of the stomach lining A functioning small intestine is also necessary for the proper metabolism of the vitamin as absorption occurs within the ileum B12 is produced in the digestive tracts of all animals including humans Thus animalorigin food is the only natural food source of vitamin B12 However synthesis of B12 occurs in the large intestine which is past the point of absorption that occurs within the small intestine As such vitamin B12 must be obtained through diet Deficiencies Unlike other B vitamins which are not stored in the body B12 is stored in the liver Because of this it may take 5‚Äì10 years before a sudden dietary B12 deficiency will become apparent in a previously healthy adult B12 deficiency also known as hypocobalaminemia often results from complications involving absorption into the body B12 deficiency is often associated with pernicious anemia as it is the most common cause Pernicious anemia results from an autoimmune disorder which destroys the cells that produce intrinsic factor within the stomach lining thereby hindering B12 absorption B12 absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron thus people with pernicious anemia often present with typical symptoms of anemia such as pale skin dizziness and fatigue Among those at highest risk for B12 deficiency are the elderly population as 1015 of people aged 60 may present with some form of hypocobalaminemia High rates of deficiency in the elderly commonly results from the decrease of functional absorption of B12 as production of intrinsic factor declines with age However pernicious anemia is the most common cause of B12 deficiency in North American and European populations Those afflicted with various gastrointestinal diseases may also be at risk for deficiency as a result of malabsorption These diseases may affect production of intrinsic factor in the stomach or of pancreatic bile Diseases that involve disorders of the small intestine such as celiac disease Crohns disease and ileitis may also reduce B12 absorption For example people with celiac disease may damage the microvilli within their small intestines through the consumption of gluten thereby inhibiting absorption of B12 as well as other nutrients A diet low in B12 whether voluntary or not can also cause symptoms of hypocobalaminemia Many rich sources of B12 come from animal meats and byproducts Populations in developing countries may not have access to these foods on a consistent basis and as a result may become deficient in B12 In addition vegans and to a lesser extent vegetarians are at risk for consuming a diet low in cobalamin as they voluntarily abstain from animal sources of B12 A combination of these two scenarios may increase prevalence of cobalamin deficit For instance B12 deficiency is problematic in India where the majority of the population is vegetarian and the scarcity of meat consumption is common for omnivores as well Symptoms An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 75‚Äì90 of individuals of any age with clinically observable B12 deficiency Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord peripheral nerves optic nerves and cerebrum These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of myelin and may be expressed behaviourally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities or motor disturbances such as gait ataxia Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss disorientation and dementia All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes Mental symptoms are extremely variable and include mild disorders of mood mental slowness and memory defect Memory defect encompasses symptoms of confusion severe agitation and depression delusions and paranoid behaviour visual and auditory hallucinations urinary and fecal incontinence in the absence of overt spinal lesions dysphasia violent maniacal behaviour and epilepsy It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism as caused by the state of deficiency All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show symptoms of bleeding gums headache poor concentration shortness of breath and weakness In severe cases of pernicious anemia individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia and memory loss It is not always easy to determine whether B12 deficiency is present especially within older adults Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes They may also present with vague complaints such as fatigue or memory loss that may be attributed to normative aging processes Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimers and other dementias as well Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood Treatment  Patients deficient in B12 despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6\\xa0mg of the vitamin in pill form Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency such as pernicious anemia or old age will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B12 Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patients level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000\\xa0mg of B12 administered intramuscularly daily for one week weekly for one month then monthly for the rest of the patients life Daily oral supplementation of B12 megadoses may be sufficient in reliable patients but it is imperative that the supplementation be continued on a lifelong basis as relapse may occur otherwise The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual As a result early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B12 A deficiency in folate may produce anemia similar to the anemia resulting from B12 deficiency There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B12 deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand In this case patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B12 deficiencyrelated anemia which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency Prevention In addition to meeting intake requirements through food consumption supplementation of diet with vitamin B12 is seen as a viable preventative measure for deficiency It has been recommended for the elderly to supplement 50\\xa0mg a day in order to prevent deficit from occurring Animal protein products are a good source of B12 particularly organ meats such as kidney or liver Other good sources are fish eggs and dairy products It is suggested that vegans who consume no animal meat or byproducts supplement their diet with B12 While there are foods fortified with B12 available some may be mislabelled in an attempt to boost their nutritional claims Products of fermentation such as algae extracts and sea vegetables may be labelled as sources of B12 but actually contain B12 analogues which compete for the absorption of the nutrient itself In order to get adequate amounts of the vitamin orally administered pills or fortified foods such as cereals and soy milk are recommended for vegans Vitamin A deficiency and impaired memory Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for mammals which takes form in either retinol or the provitamin betaCarotene It helps regulation of cell division cell function genetic regulation helps enhance the immune system and is required for brain function chemical balance growth and development of the Central Nervous System and vision Learning memory In an experiment by Chongqing Medical University pregnant rats were either plentiful in Vitamin A or were of a Vitamin A deficiency VAD due to their diet The offspring of these rats were then tested in a water maze at 8 weeks old and it was found the VAD offspring had a harder time finishing the maze which helps show that these rats even while having a deficiency from In utero have more problems with learning memory Young rats in a separate study by the same university also showed impaired longterm potentiation in the hippocampus when they were VAD which shows neuronal impairment When the patient is VAD for too long the effects of the damage to the hippocampus can be irreversible Spatial memory Vitamin A affects spatial memory most of the time because the size of the nuclei in hippocampal neurons are reduced by approximately 70 when there is a deficiency which affects a persons abilities for higher cognitive function In a study by the University Of Cagliari Italy VAD rats had more trouble learning a Radial arm maze than rats who had normal levels of the vitamin The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had Vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve it Here it was found that the Retinoid receptors which help transport Vitamin A were of normal function Prevention treatment and symptoms Eating foods high in Vitamin A or taking dietary supplements Retinol or Retinal will prevent a deficiency The foods highest in Vitamin A are any pigmented fruits and vegetables and leafy green vegetables also provide betaCarotene There can be symptoms of fat loss and a reduction of any weight gain that would be considered normal for an individual especially developmental weight gains such as in infants which would occur if the infant was deprived of Vitamin A while In utero andor if it was deprived postnatal for an extensive period of time The deficiency can also cause conditions such as blindness or night blindness also known as Nyctalopia Night blindness is due to the inability to regenerate Rhodopsin in the rods which is needed in dim light in order to see properly A treatment of supplements of Retinoic acid which is a part of Vitamin A can help replenish levels and help bring learning to normal but after 39 weeks this is ineffective even if the treatment is daily because it will not bring the retinoid hyposignalling back to normal Relationship with zinc Zinc is a very important part of the brain as well many regions of the brain such as the cerebellum and hippocampus have neurons that contain this nutrient Zinc is needed to maintain normal Vitamin A levels in blood plasma It was found that VAD rats had lower plasma Retinol levels It also helps Vitamin A become metabolized by the Liver However evidence suggests that when someone is deficient in both Vitamin A and zinc memory is more improved when just Vitamin A is increased than when just zinc is increased Of course Memory has the largest improvement when both are increased When one of these nutrients is not balanced the other is most likely to be affected because they rely on each other for proper functioning in learning Aging and cognitive disease Foods that are rich in Omega3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease risk of getting Alzheimers disease Omega3 fatty acids primarily Docosahexanoic acid DHA which is the most prevalent omega3 fatty acid found in neurons have been studied extensively for use in possible prevention and therapy of Alzheimers disease Some studies crosssectional suggest that reduced intake or low brain levels of DHA are associated with earlier development of cognitive deficits or development of dementia including Alzheimers disease Several clinical trials suggest that omega3 fatty acid supplementation does not have significant effects in the treatment of Alzheimers disease‚Äîwhich in turn may suggest that the protective benefits of omega3 fatty acid supplementation could depend on the scope of the disease and other confounding factors A diet that is rich in antioxidants will also help get rid of free radicals in your body which could be a cause for Alzheimers The buildup of Beta Amyloid plaques a marker highly associated with Alzheimers disease generates cell damaging free radicals Therefore the role of antioxidants as protectants against Alzheimers disease has become a hot topic of study Simple dietary modification towards fewer highly processed carbohydrates and relatively more fats ad cholesterol is likely a protective measure against Alzheimers disease Additionally folic acid has also been found to improve the memory of older people There is some evidence that deficiency in folic acid may increase the risk of dementia especially Alzheimers disease and vascular dementia but there is debate about whether it lowers risk of cognitive impairment in the older population Folic acid supplementation is shown to lower blood homocysteine levels while folic acid deficiency can lead to a condition of high levels of homocysteine Hcy in the bloodstream called hyperhomocysteinemia HHcy HHcy is related to several vascular diseases such as coronary artery disease peripheral vascular disease and stroke Recently HHcy was found to play a role in the development of Alzheimers disease In an experiment that gave one group of mice a folic acid deficient diet and the other group a diet treated with placebo the folic acid deficient group developed higher blood Hcy levels as well as more beta amyloid AŒ≤ peptides the building blocks of Beta Amyloid plaques which are deposits found in the brains of those with Alzheimers disease Dementia Dementia is a common form of age related cognitive decline Dementia interferes with normal functioning operations as well as a significant amount of memory loss 25‚Äì29 million people over the world suffer from dementia Alzheimers disease is considered as the most common cause of dementia in people age 65 and older estimated at 15‚Äì20 in this age group The incidence and prevalence of Alzheimers disease tends to increase exponentially with age leading experts to suggest that the reported 5 million persons in the US 2010 would quadruple by year 2050 unless effective treatment is developed One kind of Dementia is Vascular dementia which has risk factor for strokes that are related to nutrition such has diabetes and obesity Increased blood pressure can raise the risk for dementia There have been several amino acid studies done on dementia There is a significant less amount of tryptophan and methionine in people who have dementia Another amino acid homocysteine plays a role in the physiology of people with dementia Antioxidants play a role in neutralizing free radicals which put you at a higher risk for cancer as well as dementia Alzheimers dementia The Alzheimers Association estimates that 1 in 10 people over age 65 and nearly half of people over 85 have Alzheimers disease There is no clear identifying impairment pattern It is identified by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrallary tangles in the hippocampus Some symptoms are forgetting trouble with words and names delusions and hallucinations Moderate or mild malnutrition can cause an increased risk for Alzheimers About 4 million Americans a year are classified with Alzheimers See also Nutrition Nootropic Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome Pellagra Neurulation Nutritional neuroscience References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'People living with HIVAIDS face increased challenges in maintaining proper nutrition Despite developments in medical treatment nutrition remains a key component in managing this condition The challenges that those living with HIVAIDS face can be the result of the viral infection itself or from the effects of antiHIV therapy HAART Some of the side effects from HAART that may affect how the body absorbs and utilizes nutrients include fatigue nausea and poor appetite As well the nutritional needs of people with HIVAIDS are greater due to their immune system fighting off opportunistic infections that do not normally cause disease in people with healthy immune systems Medication along with proper nutrition is a major component of maintaining good health and quality of life for people living with HIVAIDS    HIVAIDS and nutritional needs Energy requirements Monitoring caloric intake is important in ensuring that energy needs are met For people with HIVAIDS energy requirements often increase in order to maintain their regular body weight A classification system revised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC categorizes HIVinfection into 3 clinical stages and addresses the suggested caloric requirements for each stage 1 Clinical Category A Asymptomatic HIV This stage is characterized by Acute HIV People in this category have estimated needs of 3035 kcalskg 2 Clinical Category B Symptomatic HIV This stage is characterized by complications that arise from HIV symptoms People in this category have estimated needs of 3540 kcalskg 3 Clinical Category C Presence of AIDS condition This stage is characterized by having a Tcell count under 200 signaling the presence of an AIDS defining condition andor an opportunistic infection People in this category have estimated needs of 40‚Äì50 kcalskg and are at an increased risk of malnourishment Micronutrient requirements Multivitamins and supplementation The World Health Organization WHO issued consultative recommendatons regarding nutrient requirements in HIVAIDS A generally healthy diet was promoted For HIVinfected adults the WHO recommended micronutrient intake comes from a good diet at RDA levels higher intake of vitamin A zinc and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV positive adults and these were not recommended unless there is documented deficiency Despite the WHO recommendations recent reviews have highlighted the absence of a simple consensus regarding the effects of multivitamins or micronutrient and nutrient supplementation on HIV positive individuals This is partly due to a lack of strong scientific evidence Some studies have looked into the use of implementing daily multivitamins into the diet regimens of HIVAIDS patients One study done in Tanzania involved a trial group with one thousand HIV positive pregnant women Findings showed that daily multivitamins benefited both the mothers and their babies After four years the multivitamins were found to reduce the women‚Äôs risk of AIDS and death by approximately 30 Another trial in Thailand revealed that the use of multivitamins led to fewer deaths but only among people in advanced stages of HIV However not all studies have provided a positive correlation A small trial done in Zambia found no benefits from multivitamins after one month of use Regarding individual vitamin and mineral supplementation research shows mixed results Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity rates among African children suffering from HIV The World Health Organization WHO recommends vitamin A supplements for all young children 6 to 59 months old that are at high risk of vitamin A deficiency every 4 to 6 months In contrast a trial from Tanzania found that the use of vitamin A supplements increased the risk of mothertochild transmission by 40 With the inconsistency of these results scientists have not reached a consensus regarding Vitamin A supplementation and its possible benefits for HIVAIDS patients Other vitamins to be taken by HIVinfected adults are vitamins C and E Evidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children reduces mortality and improves growth For nutritionally compromised pregnant and lactating women a multivitamin supplementation has improved outcomes for both mothers and children Thus further research is required to determine the relationship between supplements and HIVAIDS in order to develop effective nutritional interventions Effects of HIVAIDS on nutrition Statistics show that HIVAIDS is most prevalent in the SubSaharan African region And according to the hunger map of 2010 undernourishment is most prevalent in AsiaPacific and once again in SubSaharan Africa Some of the reasons as to why there is a correlation between malnutrition and the presence of HIVAIDS are listed below Food security Food security is present when all people at all times have access to sufficient safe nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life as defined by the World Food Summit of 1996 It is set on the basis of food availability food access and proper food use The difficulty for some people suffering from HIV and AIDS involves how they must obtain food security because the virus increases fatigue compromising their ability to work in order to provide food and food preparation This impact is even greater on those living in poverty in rural areas where providing food is largely based on farming and other household chores Case study in Malawi In Malawi the AIDS epidemic and its effect on food security for 65 rural households was studied Findings revealed that illness and death as a result of AIDS compromised household food security 24 out of 65 households had negative food security indexes meaning that they did not have enough flour andor corn to meet their daily caloric requirements Sharing of food and resources was substantially decreased to those families that were affected with HIVAIDS which proved especially detrimental in families that no longer had a prime adult With the removal of a prime adult these families were deprived of productive labor resulting in serious production deficiencies The study concludes that family members victimized by AIDS led to fracturing of interpersonal ties with other families which created food insecurity in a community based on a rural subsistence economy Malnutrition  Malnutrition can be used as a measure of food insecurity and it has the most impact on those living in SubSaharan Africa and AsiaPacific where poverty and malnutrition is most prevalent in the world It is also in SubSaharan Africa where the cases of HIVAIDS is most prevalent An individual whose body is already compromised with HIV has an immune system even less effective at defending against infections when the body is malnourished Antiretroviral drugs are now being distributed to people in these areas but when given to those who are undernourished the medicine‚Äôs effectiveness is decreased and toxicity is increased Malnutrition accelerates the onset of the disease and give rise to repeated illnesses because of their weakened immune systems Consequently HIV and malnutrition provide a cyclic form of feedback for each other with worsening conditions of malnutrition being linked to a more rapid onset of HIV Food safety For other uses see food safety People living with AIDS have impaired immune systems and therefore are more susceptible to infections and diseases due to foodborne pathogens Food safety includes food handling food preparation and food storage all to be dealt with carefully to ensure safety from foodborne bacteria Those that are more prevalent in people with AIDS include Salmonella which is the most common cause of illness being 100 times more prevalent in AIDS patients than healthy individuals Another example is Listeriosis caused by listeria monocytogenes with severe and often fatal consequences when encountered by a persons with AIDS Simple measures can be used to increase food safety and prevent foodborne illnesses for those with affected with HIVAIDS Washing your hands the food about to be prepared kitchen utensils and kitchen surfaces is effective against bacterial growth Keeping raw meat and cooked meat separate and cooking foods thoroughly using a food thermometer to be sure And lastly storing leftover foods in the refrigerator within two hours to ensure minimal risk of foodborne illnesses Research There are some areas of research that have either not been explored or researched indepth that are related to the area of HIVAIDS treatment Food sustainability and agriculture With food security also having an impact in rural areas affected by HIVAIDS another area of research involves agriculture in subsistence economies More specifically in these areas where households affected by HIVAIDS may suffer from food insecurity focuses for future research may include looking into ways to improve agricultural practices in order to enhance the household food production of families where one or more adults suffer from HIVAIDS  References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutrition and pregnancy refers to the nutrient intake and dietary planning that is undertaken before during and after pregnancy Nutrition of the fetus begins at conception For this reason the nutrition of the mother is important from before conception probably several months before as well as throughout pregnancy and breast feeding An everincreasing number of studies have shown that the nutrition of the mother will have an effect on the child up to and including the risk for cancer cardiovascular disease hypertension and diabetes throughout life An inadequate or excessive amount of some nutrients may cause malformations or medical problems in the fetus and neurological disorders and handicaps are a risk that is run by mothers who are malnourished 238 of babies worldwide are estimated to be born with lower than optimal weights at birth due to lack of proper nutrition Personal habits such as smoking alcohol caffeine using certain medications and street drugs can negatively and irreversibly affect the development of the baby which happens in the early stages of pregnancy Caffeine is sometimes assumed to cause harm to the unborn baby but there is not enough evidence so say if this is true A recent review showed that more research is needed to show whether caffeine intake effects birth weight preterm births gestational diabetes and other outcomes    Nutrition before pregnancy Beneficial prepregnancy nutrients As with most diets there are chances of oversupplementing however as general advice both state and medical recommendations are that mothers follow instructions listed on particular vitamin packaging as to the correct or recommended daily allowance RDA Daily prenatal use of iron substantially improves birth weight potentially reducing the risk of Low birth weight Folic acid supplementation is recommended prior to conception to prevent development of spina bifida and other neural tube defects It should be taken as at least 04\\xa0mgday throughout the first trimester of pregnancy 06\\xa0mgday through the pregnancy and 05\\xa0mgday while breastfeeding in addition to eating foods rich in folic acid such as green leafy vegetables Iodine levels are frequently too low in pregnant women and iodine is necessary for normal thyroid function and mental development of the fetus even cretinism Pregnant women should take prenatal vitamins containing iodine Vitamin D levels vary with exposure to sunlight While it was assumed that supplementation was necessary only in areas of high latitudes recent studies of Vitamin D levels throughout the United States and many other countries have shown a large number of women with low levels For this reason there is a growing movement to recommend supplementation with 1000\\xa0mg of Vitamin D daily throughout pregnancy vitamin D is necessary to prevent rickets a disease causing weak bones A large number of pregnant women have been found to have low levels of vitamin B12 but supplementation has not yet been shown to improve pregnancy outcome or the health of the newborn although there are suspicions Polyunsaturated fatty acids specifically docosahexaenoic acid DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA are very beneficial for fetal development Several studies have shown a small drop in preterm delivery and in low birth weight in mothers with higher intakes The best dietary source of omega3 fatty acids is oily fish Some other omega3 fatty acids not found in fish can be found in foods such as flaxseeds walnuts pumpkin seeds and enriched eggs Iron is needed for the healthy growth of the fetus and placenta especially during the second and third trimesters It is also essential before pregnancy for the production of hemoglobinThere is no evidence that a hemoglobin level of 7 grams100 ml or higher is detrimental to pregnancy but it must be acknowledged that maternal hemorrhage is a major source of maternal mortality worldwide and a reserve capacity to carry oxygen is desirable According to the Cochrane review conclusions iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear Nutrition during pregnancy During the early stages of pregnancy since the placenta is not yet formed there is no mechanism to protect the embryo from the deficiencies which may be inherent in the mothers circulation Thus it is critical that an adequate amount of nutrients and energy is consumed Multiple micronutrient supplements taken with iron and folic acid can improve birth outcomes for women in low income countries These supplements reduce numbers of low birth weight babies small for gestational age babies and stillbirths in women who may not have many micronutrients in their usual diets Undernourished women can benefit from having dietary education sessions and balanced energy and protein supplements A review showed that dietary education increased the mother‚Äôs protein intake and helped the baby grow more inside the womb The balanced protein and energy supplement lowered risk of stillbirth and small babies and increased weight gain for both the mother and baby Although more research is needed into the longer term effects on the mothers‚Äô and infants‚Äô health the short term effects look promising Supplementing ones diet with foods rich in folic acid fruits and dark green leafy vegetables Excluding citrus helps to prevent neural tube birth defects in the fetus In addition prenatal vitamins typically contain increased amounts of folic acid iodine iron vitamin A vitamin D zinc and calcium over the amounts found in standard multivitamins Zinc supplements have reduced preterm births by around 14 mainly in low income countries No other benefits were seen4 The World Health Organisation does not routinely recommend zinc supplementation for pregnant women because there is not enough good quality evidence For women with low calcium diets taking calcium supplementation can reduce their risk of preeclampsia It has also been suggested that calcium can reduce numbers of births that happen before the 37th week of pregnancy preterm birth However a more recent review looking into other benefits of calcium supplementation did not find any improvement in numbers of preterm or low birth weight babies There is not enough good quality to research to suggest best doses and timing of calcium supplementation Pregnant women are advised to pay attention to the foods they eat during pregnancy such as soft cheese and certain fish in order to reduce the risk of exposure to substances or bacteria that may be harmful to the developing fetus This can include food pathogens and toxic food components alcohol and dietary supplements such as vitamin A and potentially harmful pathogens such as listeria toxoplasmosis and salmonella Dietary vitamin A is obtained in two forms which contain the preformed vitamin retinol that can be found in some animal products such as liver and fish liver oils and as a vitamin A precursor in the form of carotene which can be found in many fruits and vegetables Intake of large amounts or conversely a deficiency of retinol has been linked to birth defects and abnormalities It is noted that a 100\\xa0g serving of liver may contain a large amount of retinol so it is best that it is not eaten daily during pregnancy Excessive amounts of alcohol have been proven to cause fetal alcohol syndrome The World Health Organization recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy Although seafood contains high levels of Omega3 fatty acids which are beneficial for both mother and the baby but there is no consensus on consuming seafood during pregnancy Pregnant women are advised to eat seafood in moderation Folic acid Folic acid which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate is critical both in preand periconception Deficiencies in folic acid may cause neural tube defects women who had 04\\xa0mg of folic acid in their systems due to supplementing 3 months before childbirth significantly reduced the risk of NTD within the fetus The development of every human cell is dependent on an adequate supply of folic acid Folic acid governs the synthesis of the precursors of DNA which is the nucleic acid that gives each cell life and character Folic acid deficiency results in defective cellular growth and the effects are most obvious on those tissues which grow most rapidly Water During pregnancy ones mass increases by about 12\\xa0kg Most of this added weight 6 to 9 L is water because the plasma volume increases 85 of the placenta is water and the fetus itself is 7090 water This means that hydration is an important aspect of nutrition throughout pregnancy The European Food Safety Authority recommends an increase of 300 mL per day compared to the normal intake for nonpregnant women taking the total adequate water intake from food and fluids to 2300 mL or approximately 1850 mL day from fluids alone Nutrition after pregnancy Proper nutrition is important after delivery to help the mother recover and to provide enough food energy and nutrients for a woman to breastfeed her child Women having serum ferritin less than 70\\xa0¬µgL may need iron supplements to prevent iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy and postpartum During lactation water intake may need to be increased Human milk is made of 88 water and the IOM recommends that breastfeeding women increase their water intake by about 300 mLday to a total volume of 3000 mLday from food and drink approximately 2400 mLday from fluids See also Fetal alcohol

       "  'raw page text': 'The nutrition facts label also known as the nutrition information panel and other slight variations is a label required on most packaged food in many countries Updates can be infrequent For example the United States established rules for Nutrition Facts panel in 1990 and did not revise those rules until 2016 Most countries also release overall nutrition guides for general educational purposes In some cases the guides are based on different dietary targets for various nutrients than the labels on specific foods    Australia and New Zealand Australia and New Zealand use a nutritional information panel of the following format Other items are included as appropriate and the units may be varied as appropriate eg substituting ml for g or mmol for mg in the Sodium row In April 2013 the New Zealand government introduced rules around common claims made on food packaging such as low in fat Canada  In Canada a standardized Nutrition Facts label was introduced as part of regulations passed in 2003 and became mandatory for most prepackaged food products on December 12 2005 Smaller businesses were given until December 12 2007 to make the information available In accordance with food packaging laws in the country all information including the nutrition label must be written in both English and French the countrys two official languages Canadian regulation tightly controls the manner in which the nutrition fact table NFT data are laid out There is a wide variety of possible formats for use on a given food package A selection hierarchy is used to select among the many formats 28 main formats and 27 sub formats for each This results in standard vertical formats being considered for use before horizontal and linear formats The selection hierarchy also allows the NFT to occupy no more than 15 of the physical packages available display area ADS but never to be smaller than a format that would be lt15 of ADS In practice determining the ADS of a package and selecting the appropriate NFT format can be a detailed calculation European Union   It was regulated by the Commission Directive 2008100EC of 28 October 2008 amending Council Directive 90496EEC on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs as regards recommended daily allowances energy conversion factors and definitions A new regulation is now in force Regulation 11692011 Nutritional labelling becomes mandatory for most prepackaged foods as from December 2016 In the European Union along the old rules Directive 90496 amended the information usually in panel format is most often labelled Nutrition Information or equivalent in other EU languages An example is shown on the right The panel is optional but if provided the prescribed content and format must be followed It will always give values for a set quantity\\xa0‚Äî 100\\xa0g 35\\xa0oz or 100\\xa0ml 35\\xa0imp\\xa0fl\\xa0oz 34\\xa0US\\xa0fl\\xa0oz of the product\\xa0‚Äî and often also for a defined serving as an option First will come the energy values in both kilocalories and kilojoules Then will come a breakdown of constituent elements usually most or all of protein carbohydrate starch sugar fat fibre and sodium The fat figure is likely to be further broken down into saturated and unsaturated fat while the carbohydrate figure is likely to give a subtotal for sugars With the new rules the mandatory information is energy fat saturates carbohydrates sugars protein and salt in that particular order with options to extend this list to monounsaturates polyunsaturates polyols starch fibre and vitamins and minerals With regards to health claims and nutrition composition claims these are harmonised in the EU through Regulation 19242006 amended In November 2012 the European Commission published two new regulations Regulation EC No 10472012 and Regulation EC No10482012 Certain nutrition claim groups as of Regulation EC No 19242006 had to be changed Moreover the health claims associated to barley betagluten were amended eg lowering blood cholesterol Within Regulation 1924 there are legal definitions of terms such as low fat high fibre reduced calories All health claims have been harmonised in the European Union They can be used if they have been approved by EFSA The list of approved and rejected claims is available on a web site Provided the full nutrition information is shown on the packet additional nutritional information and formats eg a traffic light rating system may be included and this falls outside the scope of regulation The United Kingdom regulations are given in Schedules 6 and 7 of the Food Labelling Regulations 1996  Hong Kong In Hong Kong nutrition facts labels are regulated by the subsidiary legislation Food and Drugs Composition and Labelling Amendment Requirements for Nutrition Labelling and Nutrition Claim Regulation 2008 India The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had on September 19 2008 notified the Prevention of Food Adulteration 5th Amendment Rules 2008 mandating packaged food manufacturers to declare on their product labels nutritional information and a mark from the FPO or Agmark Companies that are responsible for checking food products to enable consumers make informed choices while purchasing Prior to this amendment disclosure of nutritional information was largely voluntary though many large manufacturers tend to adopt the international practice Mexico Food products sold in Mexico use the NOM051SCFI1994 Informaci√≥n nutrimental product labelling standard very similar to Nutrition Facts in the US The Official Mexican Standard or NOM Norma Oficial Mexicana was developed by the Mexican Secretary of Commerce and Industrial Promotion Secretar√≠a de Comercio y Fomento Industrial now a part of the Secretary of the Economy SECOFI It entered into effect on January 24 1996 and defines General specifications for labelling foods and prebottled nonalcoholic beverages United States In the United States the Nutritional Facts label lists the percentage supplied that is recommended to be met or to be limited in one day of human nutrients based on a daily diet of 2000 calories With certain exceptions such as foods meant for babies the following Daily Values are used These are called Reference Daily Intake RDI values and were originally based on the highest 1968 Recommended Dietary Allowances RDA for each nutrient in order to assure that the needs of all age and sex combinations were met These are older than the current Recommended Dietary Allowances of the Dietary Reference Intake For vitamin C vitamin D vitamin E vitamin K calcium phosphorus magnesium and manganese the current highest RDAs are up to 50 higher than the older Daily Values used in labeling whereas for other nutrients the recommended needs have gone down A sidebyside table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake As of October 2010 the only micronutrients that are required to be included on all labels are vitamin A vitamin C calcium and iron To determine the nutrient levels in the foods companies may develop or use databases and these may be submitted voluntarily to the US Food and Drug Administration for review Additionally there is a requirement for ingredients to be listed in order from highest to lowest quantity according to their weight   The label was mandated for most food products under the provisions of the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act NLEA per the recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration It was one of several controversial actions taken during the tenure of FDA Commissioner Dr David Kessler The law required food companies to begin using the new food label on packaged foods beginning May 8 1994 Meat and poultry products were not covered by NLEA though the US Department of Agriculture proposed similar regulations for voluntary labeling of raw meat and poultry Foods labeled before that day could use the old label This appeared on all products in 1995 The old label was titled Nutrition Information Per Serving or simply Nutrition Information The label begins with a standard serving measurement calories are listed second and then following is a breakdown of the constituent elements Always listed are total fat sodium carbohydrates and protein the other nutrients usually shown may be suppressed if they are zero Usually all 15 nutrients are shown calories calories from fat fat saturated fat trans fat cholesterol sodium carbohydrates dietary fiber sugars protein vitamin A vitamin C calcium and iron Products containing less than 5\\xa0g of fat show amounts rounded to the nearest 05\\xa0g Amounts less than 05\\xa0g are rounded to 0\\xa0g For example if a product contains 045\\xa0g of trans fat per serving and the package contains 18 servings the label would show 0\\xa0g of trans fat even though the product actually contains a total of 81\\xa0g of trans fat In addition to the nutrition label products may display certain nutrition information or health claims on packaging These health claims are only allowed by the FDA for eight diet and health relationships based on proven scientific evidence including calcium and osteoporosis fibercontaining grain products fruits and vegetables and cancer fruits vegetables and grain products that contain fiber‚Äîparticularly soluble fiber‚Äîand the risk of coronary heart disease fat and cancer saturated fat and cholesterol and coronary heart disease sodium and hypertension and folate and neural tube defects The Institute of Medicine recommended these labels contain the most useful nutritional information for consumers saturated fats trans fats sodium calories and serving size In January 2011 food manufacturers and grocery stores announced plans to display some of this nutrition information on processed food The nutrition facts label currently appears on more than 65 billion food packages President Bill Clinton issued an award of design excellence for the nutrition facts label in 1997 to Burkey Belser in Washington DC The FDA does not require any specific typeface be used in the Nutrition Facts label mandating only that the label utilize a single easytoread type style though its example label uses Helvetica However as regulated by the FDA and the USDA it is mandatory for certain information listed in the label to be written in English including name of the product net quantity serving size and number of servings per package nutrition facts ingredient list and name of manufacturer or distributor The smallest lettering should be at least 116th of an inch tall 15875 millimeters based on the height of a lowercase o In 2009 a federal appellate court rejected the New York State Restaurant Association‚Äôs challenge to the city‚Äôs 2007 regulation requiring most major fastfood and chain restaurants to prominently display calorie information on their menus The rule applies to restaurants that are part of chains with at least 15 establishments doing business nationally Alcoholic beverages are under the jurisdiction of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau TTB and as of 2012 are not required to have a nutrition facts label Since at least 2003 consumer groups have lobbied the TTB to require labelling disclosing relevant information Marketing terms such as light for beers and wines and table wine do have specific requirements and in certain cases alcohol content must be disclosed In January 2006 Trans fat was required to be listed under saturated fat This was the first significant change to the Nutrition Facts panel since it was introduced in 1993 Revision to Nutrition Facts panel In 2014 the US Food and Drug Administration proposed several simultaneous improvements to nutrition labeling for the first time in over 20 years The proposed changes were based on trends of consumption of nutrients of public health importance However studies had shown that the majority of the US population could not understand the information in the then current Nutrition Facts Label Nutrition label numeracy is particularly low in older individuals of black and Hispanic raceethnicity who are unemployed born outside of the US have lower English proficiency lower education achievement lower income or live in the South Proposed changes included a new design requiring serving sizes to more accurately reflect how many servings the average individual is actually consuming The new recommendation also proposed removing ‚Äúcalories from fat‚Äù and instead focusing on total calories and type of fats being consumed in a product The proposed labels were to also list how much sugar is added rather than inherent to a product as well as declaring the amount of Vitamin D and potassium in a product Some of these changes sparked a major debate between the food industry and public health agencies The proposal to indicate sugar added during food production in particular was brought forward by the FDA as a measure to counter the increase in per capita sugar consumption in the US which over the last decades exceeded the limits recommended by scientific institutions and governmental agencies Major American food associations opposed the label change indicating lack of merit and no preponderance of evidence to justify the inclusion of sugar added in the new label The rules for the new design were finalized on May 20 2016 Manufacturers were initially given until July 26 2018 to comply or July 26 2019 if they have less than 10 million in annual food sales A proposed rule by the FDA would extend the compliance deadline to January 1 2020 or January 1 2021 for qualified small business For food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amounts of vitamins and nutritionally essential minerals in a serving are expressed as a percent of Daily Value DV Many of the definitions of 100 Daily Value were changed as part of the revision A table of the old and new

       "  'raw page text': 'Antiquity is referred to as the time period before the Middle Ages which began around 500AD The major civilizations are those of the Mediterranean region ancient Greece ancient Rome and southwest Asia Nutrition consisted of simple fresh whole foods that were either locally grown or transported from neighboring towns during times of crisis Physicians and philosophers studied the effect of food on the human body and they generally agreed that food was important in preventing illness and restoring health    Food of Antiquity People ate various types of food consumers had choices from dairy milk and cheese fruits figs pears apples and pomegranates vegetables greens and bulbs Grains and legumes cereal wheat barley millet beans and chickpeas and meat beef mutton fowl muscles and oysters Food was most often fresh but the processing of food aided in the preservation for long term storage or transport to other cities Cereals olives wine legumes vegetables fruit and animal products could all be processed and stored for later use Cereals were often processed and stored in the form of bread flatcakes and porridge Legumes were also most often processed and stored as pulses and eaten with bread to enhance the flavor Cereals were most nourishing providing essential macro and micronutrients to consumers Cereals sustained individuals with sufficient amounts of protein vitamin B vitamin E calcium and iron Fruits and vegetables provided vitamin A vitamin C vitamin D and half the dietary fiber needed for health support Food Shortage Cities depended on trade with agricultural farmers and neighboring cities for food supply due to the lack of land cultivation area Food supply was altered by numerous events such as climate location and distribution Weather drastically affected the amount of produce harvested during a growing season Climate often fluctuated in the Mediterranean region with varying temperatures and volumes of precipitation these two factors also affected the quality of soil available to farmers Soil composition mainly depended on location but the climate affected the moisture retained within the soil If the growing season was not prosperous then cities would have to resort to trade as a means for food supply This often made food distribution difficult due to political disagreements and issues with transportation To combat hunger due to inadequate food supply people would eat twigs roots of plants bark from trees and each other as a last resort Food shortages were frequent but didn‚Äôt last long enough to generate famine People of Interest  Pythagoras 570 BC ‚Äì 495 BC was a Greek philosopher mathematician and is also considered to be ‚Äúthe Father of Ethical Vegetarianism‚Äù He believed that in order to obtain the highest level of spiritual and physical health it was necessary to follow a lifestyle that included a vegetarian diet which excluded meats and other flesh foods Anaxagoras 500 BC ‚Äì 428 BC was also a Greek philosopher he suggested that foods that we ate contained fragments that were needed for growth in the body His belief was that ‚Äúeverything is in everything at all times‚Äù physical characteristics hair nails flesh etc were generated from foods that contained those same substances Hippocrates 460 BC ‚Äì 377 BC was a physician known as the ‚Äúfather of medicine‚Äù his nutritional advice was based on the presence of the four humors in the body Plato 428427 BC ‚Äì 348347 BC was a Greek philosopher and mathematician his idea of a healthy diet consisted of balance and moderation of cereals fruits vegetables dairy with a strong emphasis on the moderation of meat and wine His belief is that excess food from one source would lead to future ailments Galen 129 AD ‚Äì 216 AD built much of his work by challenging the writings of others He was an admirer of Hippocrates because of the work he had done in the field of medicine Galen believed that Hippocrates had stated all that needed to be known about nutrition and he would interpret his work by the presentation of his own knowledge Medicine The humoral theory of medicine was central to medicine during antiquity and for centuries following Physicians believed that the body contained a mixture of bodily fluids the four humors black bile yellow bile phlegm and blood They assessed a patients‚Äô degree of health based on the balance of these four bodily fluids Diet was the first prescribed treatment of disease followed by drugs then surgery Early physicians studied the different ways foods would affect the humors of the body by restoring health or causing disease Utilizing knowledge about how humors were affected by diet physicians prescribed diets with balance moderation and timing in mind Galen worked extensively on classifying foods according to how they interacted with the humors of the body Galen had also noted that some foods had drug characteristics and for that reason during food preparation

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutrition psychology NP is the psychological study of how cognitive choices such as meal decisions influence nutrition psychological health and overall health Nutrition psychology seeks to understand the relationship between nutritional behavior and mental healthwellbeing NP is a subfield of psychology and more specifically of health psychology It may be applied to numerous different fields including psychology dietetics nutrition and marketing NP is a fairly new field with a brief history that has already started to contribute information and knowledge to psychology There are two main areas of controversy within nutrition psychology The first area of controversy is that the topic can be viewed as nutrition affecting psychological functions or can be viewed as psychological choices and behavior influencing nutrition and health The second controversy being the defining of what is healthy or normal as related to nutrition    Overview Nutrition is defined as the act or process of nourishing or being nourished specifically the sum of the processes by which an animal or plant takes in and utilizes food substances and psychology is defined as the study of mind and behavior in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity in this case the particular field is nutrition Therefore nutrition psychology is the study of mind and behavior in relation to the process of taking in and utilizing food Objectives Today over one third of American adults are considered obese and nutrition psychology aims to explain what psychological reasons may be behind this and other health trends Nutrition psychology looks at the internal psychological effects of why people do what they do and how they are shaped and influenced by outside stimuli Origins and development Nutrition psychology is a field that is still in its early stages of development With obesity a continually growing problem in the United States and abroad nutrition psychology is gaining importance and popularity in society today As it has grown nutrition psychology has directly and indirectly influenced research on dieting food labels the way food is marketed food technology obesity and the attitude of the public towards food among other topics Some research discusses the idea of Food faddism which is loosely defined as the idea that too much weight is put upon the influence of food and diet on overall health and that claims whether good or bad are often exaggerated This idea of food choices having extreme consequences is thought to be deeply ingrained into culture possibly stemming from the story of Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit Applications Food labels In 1990 the US Food and Drug Administration FDA required that nutrition labels be put on food products in the United States The thought behind doing so was to provide consumers with the necessary information to make educated decisions about the foods that they purchased Since that time nutrition psychologists have done research on how influential these labels are on how consumers choose what foods to buy These studies have shown mixed results concerning the effects of nutritional labeling According to the research the average consumer does tend to read the labels and take the information into consideration in part because companies have begun producing foods with more healthconscious ingredients However many of these potential health benefits are overshadowed by the continuing increase in obesity and deaths related to obesity in the United States over the last few decades Marketing As with any industry marketing plays an important role in the buying and selling of food products Marketing campaigns for food and beverages are increasingly prevalent today and are larger in scope than ever before given the resources that large corporations are able to use in the forms of social media and viral marketing Some researchers claim that the dramatic rise in obesity rates are at least in part due to an increase in the marketing of food over the past 30 years New marketing strategies have taken many forms including changing the packaging of the food or beverage itself product placement in media advertisements in schools increased focus on value meals with larger portions and endorsements by athletes or celebrities Many of these methods increase exposure to younger consumers who studies show tend to be more impressionable than adults and whose eating patterns as children can continue long into their adult lives Food technology Recently food has been a source of technological development Nutrition psychologists have studied the publics perception of food technology such as genetic modification or additives that may extend the shelf life of food among other topics In general the findings show that the average consumer is more likely to avoid food that is affected by technology and will prefer organic allnatural choices These technological effects are often perceived by consumers to pose health risks even if those claims are not founded in facts Fad diets Nutrition psychology has many applications not only related to how and what people eat on a daytoday basis but also the ways in which and why they diet and exercise Fad diets are popular in todays society and they usually play heavily on potential customers ideals about what they should weigh or look like These diets usually include an extreme condition or restriction on a persons food intake that supposedly will result in weight loss People become attracted to these weight loss claims because of the potential ease with which the weight loss can happen However these claims are not always founded in scientific research In popular culture The 2004 documentary film Super Size Me directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock focuses on the ways in which the fast food industry in America is influencing how people and especially young children view nutrition See also Health

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutrition transition is the shift in dietary consumption and energy expenditure that coincides with economic demographic and epidemiological changes Specifically the term is used for the transition of developing countries from traditional diets high in cereal and fiber to more Western pattern diets high in sugars fat and animalsource food    Historical framework The nutrition transition model was first proposed in 1993 by Barry Popkin and is the most cited framework in literature regarding the nutrition transition although it has been subject to some criticism for being overly simplified Popkin posits that two other historic transitions affect and are affected by nutritional transition The first is the demographic transition whereby a pattern of high fertility and high mortality transforms to one of low fertility and low mortality Secondly an epidemiological transition occurs wherein a shift from a pattern of high prevalence of infectious diseases associated with malnutrition and with periodic famine and poor environmental sanitation to a pattern of high prevalence of chronic and degenerative diseases associated with urbanindustrial lifestyles is shown These concurrent and dynamically influenced transitions share an emphasis on the ways in which populations move from one pattern to the next Popkin used five broad patterns to help summarize the nutrition transition model While these patterns largely appear chronological it is important to note that they are not restricted to certain periods of human history and still characterize certain geographic and socioeconomic subpopulations The first pattern is that of collecting food a characterization of huntergatherers whose diets were high in carbohydrates and low in fat especially saturated fat The second pattern is defined by famine a marked scarcity and reduced variation of the food supply The third pattern is one of receding famine Fruits vegetables and animal protein consumption increases and starchy staples become less important in the diet The fourth pattern is one of degenerative diseases onset by a diet high in total fat cholesterol sugar and other refined carbohydrates and low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber This pattern is often accompanied by an increasingly sedentary lifestyle The fifth pattern and most recently emerging pattern is characterized by a behavioral change reflective of a desire to prevent or delay degenerative diseases Recent and rapid changes seen in developing countries from the second and third pattern to the fourth is the common focus of nutrition transition research and desire for policy that would emphasize a healthier overall diet characterizes the shift from the fourth to the fifth pattern Relation to economic development The nutrition transition has much of its roots in economic factors related to the development of a nation or subpopulations within a nation It was once believed that current nutrition transition was endemic only to industrialized nations like the United States but increasing research has indicated that not only is nutrition transition occurring most rapidly in low and middleincome developing countries the stress of its effects stands to burden the poorest populations of these countries the most as well This shift is attributable to many causes Globalization has played a large role in altering the access and availability of foods in formerly undeveloped nations Demographic shifts from rural to urban areas are central to this as well as the liberalization of food markets global food marketing and the emergence of transnational food companies in developing countries All these forces of globalization are creating lifestyle changes that contribute to the nutrition transition Technological advancements are making previously arduous labor less difficult and thus altering energy expenditure that would have helped offset the caloric increases in the diet Daily tasks and leisure are also affected by technological advancements and contributing to greater rates of inactivity The aforementioned increases in calorie are due to increased consumption of edible oils animalsource foods caloric sweeteners accompanied by reduced consumption of grains and fruits and vegetables These changes play into human biological preferences seen across the world Socioeconomic factors also play an important role as do cultural values tied to appearance and status Globalization and economic factors The current nutrition transition seen in the emerging markets of Asia Latin America the Middle East North Africa and urban areas of subSaharan Africa is largely a product of globalization International food trade investment commercialization and marketing are drastically impacting the availability of and access to energydense but nutrientdeficient foods causing the aforementioned shift from traditional diet Another byproduct of globalization has been a marked demographic transition in these countries from rural areas to urban ones Urban populations are more susceptible to current trends in nutrition transition because of the improved transportation commercial food distribution and marketing less laborintensiveoccupations and changes in household eating habits and structure The liberalization of food markets has had a drastic effect on consumption patterns across the globe Liberalization and commercialization of domestic agricultural markets are opening up food trading since this is needed to compete in the world market This had led to changes in the types of food produced and increases in amounts of food imported into developing countries which affects the relative availability and prices of different foods Food demand is being shaped by increases in income and urbanization As these rapidly developing nations continue to accrue high incomes per capita their food spending is increasing as well They elect to use these higher incomes on more caloricallydense foods that are sweeter and higher in fats For example in China for the same extra dollar of income an average Chinese person is purchasing higher calorie food today than that person would have done for the same extra yuan in 1990 Rapid urbanization has also shaped food demand globally The demographic transition from rural areas to urban populations is a well documented byproduct of globalization and technological advancements This is because agrofood systems have replaced local subsistence farming in many rural areas The supply of food is directly sculpted by increasing demand in these areas with growing income Urbanization is increasing access to new foods and therefore altering the supply chain This is why transnational food companies have grown so rapidly over the past few decades These companies are making processed and fast foods much cheaper and more widely available through the growth of transnational supermarkets and chain restaurants Food is not only easier to obtain in urban areas it is also cheaper and less timeconsuming to acquire which creates an imbalance between energy intake and output Their advertising and promotional strategies have a strong effect on consumer choices and desire Foreign direct investment is also stimulating processed food sales in these supermarkets by lowering prices and creating incentives for advertising and promotion A large proportion of this advertising is for energydense processed foods and is being directed at children and youth Technological and transportation advancements are reducing the barriers that once limited global food trade These techniques are critical to facilitating the production and distribution needed in a global market Better preservation techniques are helping to reduce waste which contributes to lower prices for consumers Technology is creating higher yields which also reduce prices Lifestyle changes The forces of globalization are strongly influencing many lifestyle changes in developing countries Major changes in economic structures from agrarian economies to industrialized economies are reducing physical activity levels in occupations around the world Even in agricultural work gaspowered technologies are helping reduce the energy expenditure needed to perform pertinent farming tasks These reduced activity levels are not just seen in the workplace but in homes as well Daily tasks that were once laborious engagements are now much easier with the help of technological advancements with examples being appliances such as washing machines refrigerators and stoves Also recent leaps in the efficiency of food production canning refrigeration freezing and packaging being a few of the most notable and improvements in cookware such as the introduction of improved metal stoves which use fossil fuels and microwave ovens have helped reduce domestic efforts greatly Leisure is being greatly impacted as well Activities such as playing sports outside are being replaced with television watching and computer games Decreasing physical leisure activities can also be contributed to urbanization wherein access to fields needed to play such games as soccer are not available due to such dense populations and their subsequent demand for land Other important lifestyle changes fueling the nutrition transition relate to the composition of diets These dietary shifts have been mentioned previously several times but deserve greater scrutiny Diets rich in legumes other vegetables and coarse grains are disappearing in all regions and countries Taking their place are diets characterized by fatrich edible and vegetable oils cheap animalsource foods high in fat and protein and artificially sweetened foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates Consumption of caloric beverages such as soda represented 21 of all calorie intake in Mexico from 1996 to 2002 Processes of globalization that have influenced food markets have made these products much cheaper flavorful and easier to produce which has in turn driven up their demand So while globalization and the accompanying economic development has created higher levels of food security for developing countries the ongoing trend of eating in a more Western fashion has caused increased rates of adverse health and childhood obesity Biopsychosocial forces The desires for these new diets and lifestyles are very understandable from a biological and psychosocial perspective For example humans have an innate preference for sweets dating back to huntergatherer populations These sweets signaled a good source of energy for huntergatherers that were not food secure This same concept also relates to human predisposition for energydense fatty foods These foods were needed to sustain long journeys and provided a safety net for times of famine Humans also desire to eliminate physical exertion This can explain the shift to more sedentary lifestyles from occupational domestic and leisurely activities that were previously much more physical taxing Socioeconomic and cultural influences also contribute to lifestyle changes associated with nutrition transition The transfer of tastes by means of tourism and open food trade has introduced developing nations to foods previously enjoyed only by industrialized countries Global food advertising and promotion has only further cemented these dietary changes Additionally some cultures view obese body types in high regard as they relate them to power beauty and affluence Several studies suggest that socioeconomic status contributes greatly to nutrition transition wherein there is a lack of healthy food alternatives completely or a lack of affordable healthy food alternatives Health and economic outcomes While increased food security is a major benefit of global nutrition transition there are a myriad of coinciding negative health and economic consequences Rates of obesity are soaring across the world and recent trends suggest that incidences of overnutrition in coming decades will overtake that of undernutrition in the developing world As well there will be a marked epidemiological shift from infectious disease to degenerative noncommunicable disease NCDs in these countries As it stands now these countries face a unique paradox in having to deal with both over and undernutrition a dual burden of malnutrition that will inevitably be accompanied by both infectious and noncommunicable diseases a dual burden of disease The economic impact will be enormous as well In addition to reduced productivity the health systems of these countries stand to face a tremendous burden Health outcomes The foremost health outcome of the global nutrition transition will be an increased prevalence of obesity across the world Obesity prevalence in developing countries increased from 23 in 1988 to 196 in 1998 Incidences are highest among women and children indicating health inequities across global populations Obesity is strongly linked to degenerative NCDs such as coronary heart disease diabetes stroke and hypertension WHO estimates place NCDs as the principal global cause of morbidity and mortality and global prevalence of chronic diseases is projected to increase substantially over the next 2 decades in developing countries Between 1990 and 2020 mortality from cardiovascular diseases CVDs in developing countries is expected to increase 120 for women and 137 for men compared to 29 and 49 respectively in industrialized countries In many of the countries facing epidemics of overnutrition there is still widespread undernutrition Dual burden of disease Deemed as a developmental challenge of epidemic proportions the double burden of disease DBD is an emerging global health challenge that exists predominately in lowtomiddle income countries More specifically the DBD refers to the dual burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseasesNCD Today over 90 per cent of the world‚Äôs disease burden occurs in developing regions and most are attributed to communicable diseases Communicable diseases are infectious diseases that ‚Äúcan be passed between people through proximity social contact or intimate contact‚Äù Common diseases in this category include whooping cough or tuberculosis HIVAIDs malaria influenza the flu and mumps As lowtomiddle income countries continue to develop the types of diseases that affecting populations within these countries shifts primarily from infectious diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia to primarily noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease cancer and obesity This shift is increasingly being referred to as the risk transition Thus as globalization and the proliferation of prepackaged foods continues traditional diets and lifestyles are changing in many developing countries As such it is becoming increasingly common to see lowtomiddle income countries battle with century old issues such as food insecurity and under nutrition in addition to emerging health epidemics such as chronic heart disease hypertension stroke and diabetes Diseases once characteristic of industrialized nations are increasingly becoming health challenges of epidemic proportions in many lowtomiddle income countries Economic impact The economic impact of these rising rates and dual burdens of disease looks to be tremendous Disability decreased quality of life greater use of health care facilities and increased absenteeism are strong associated with obesity With inadequate resources poorly construed health systems and a general lack of expertise to address the burden of infective diseases the disease burden for lowtomiddle countries is exacerbated by the rising rate of noncommunicable diseases This is often attributed to the fact that these countries by nature have illhealth systems that possess inadequate resources to detect and prevent many noncommunicable diseases‚Äù Social constructs within these countries often amplify the risk of the double burden as inequality gender and other social determinants often have a role to play in disparate access and allocation of health services and resources If current trends are maintained the World Health Organization predicts that lowandmiddle income countries will be unable to support the burden of disease within the foreseeable future Implications for policy Because of the nature of the dual burden of disease most experts endorse a holistic approach to tackling the heath complications these nations will face rather than just focusing on reducing overnutrition Public policy must be reengineered across a number of areas because of the interdisciplinary nature of this problem These suggested areas include agriculture manufacturing retail education culture trade and economics Prevention is the most costeffective method but few successful models exist Strategies should focus on especially atrisk populations such as women youth and the poor Schoolbased approaches and community initiatives have shown encouraging results Government interventions that place Pigovian taxes on unhealthy foods such as soft drinks and fast food are controversial but could manipulate the market in a way that would encourage healthier eating Other ways to manipulate the market include providing subsidies for healthier unprocessed foods that would make them cheaper and more affordable for poorer populations Political debate arises over whether obesity is an outcome of individual behavior or a consequence of an increasingly obesogenic environment In order to reduce obesity and its subsequent health and economic consequences policy will need to be targeted at both the individual and the environment Case studies Case studies for individual nations are plentiful The BRICS countries are specifically studied in great depth because of their rapidly transitioning economies but more slowly developing nations are well studied too Industrialized nations Case studies in the United States and United Kingdom are particularly bountiful Developing countries Reports based in Latin America Asia the Middle East North Africa and developed areas of subSaharan Africa are easy to find Aboriginal populations Worldwide Aboriginal populations have experienced radical changes in diet Traditional diets and food intakes have been replaced by diets consisting of foods high in fat sugar and salt This change in diet is related to the lifestyle changes during the last century for example Huntergatherer communities became more settled and traditional food gathering methods changed The nutrition transition has been linked to increased rates of noncommunicable diseases amongst Aboriginal populations Industrialization introduced a less complicated way to access food a protein rich diet was replaced by white bread processed food and sugary beverages A study conducted in northern Ontario proved that onreserve food contributed to lower calorie and higher Œ©3 PUFA intake which stabled the glucose level and prevents people from developing diabetes Traditional food of First Nations included burbot filet or muscle and moose liver Food consumption provided essential fats ie fatty acids and proteins that played a key medicinal role in the prevention and reduction of obesity and obesityrelated

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutritional anthropology is the interplay between human biology economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization Nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people    General economics and nutrition General economic summary Most scholars construe economy as involving the production distribution and consumption of goods and services within and between societies A key concept in a broad study of economies versus a particular econometric study of commodities and stock markets is social relations For instance many economic anthropologists state that the reciprocal gift exchange competitive gift exchange and impersonal market exchange are all reflective of dominant paradigms of social relations within a given society The main forms of economy extant around most of the world today in terms of a simple production distribution consumption model are subsistence based and market economies Subsistence refers to production and consumption on a smallscale of the household or community while a marketbased economy implies a much broader scale of production distribution and consumption A market economy also entails the exchange of goods for currency versus bartering commodities or being under continuing reciprocal gift exchange obligations This is not to say that market economies do not coexist with subsistence economies and other forms but that one type usually dominates within a given society However a broad array of scholarship exists stating that market economies are rapidly increasing in importance on a global scale even in societies that have traditionally relied much more heavily on subsistence production This economic shift has nutritional implications that this entry will explore further Modes of production and nutrition The most important step in understanding the links between economics and nutrition is to understand major modes of production that societies have used to produce the goods and services they have needed throughout human history these modes are foraging shifting cultivation pastoralism agriculture and industrialism Park 2006 Foraging also known as hunting and gathering is a subsistence strategy in which a group of people gathers wild plants and hunts wild animals in order to obtain food This strategy was the sole mode of existence for human beings for the vast majority of human history inclusive of the archeological and fossil record and continued to be practiced by a few groups at least into the middle part of the 20th century This mode of production is generally associated with small nomadic groups of no more than fifty also known as bands The vast majority of foraging societies do not acknowledge exclusive ownership of land or other major resources though they do acknowledge primary use rights for groups and people may individually possess small objects or tools such as a bow or cutting tools Because foraging usually involves frequent movement and taking food naturally available rather than altering landscapes for production many scholars state the foraging has a minimal negative environmental impact compared to other modes of production Though foragers are generally limited in absolute amount of food available in a given area foraging groups such as the Kung in the Kalahari Desert have often been cited as having a more diverse diet and spending less time per week procuring food than societies that practice other modes of production such as intensive agriculture Shifting cultivation is a mode of production involving the low intensity production of plantbased foods this mode is also known as horticulture or ‚Äòslash and burn agriculture‚Äô in some texts Horticultural societies are generally situated in semisedentary villages of a few hundred that clear a field and burn the cleared vegetation in order to use the ashes to nourish the soil hence the phrase slash and burn Next the group plants a crop or crops in this clearing and uses it for cultivation for several years At the end of this period the entire village relocates and starts the process anew leaving the old clearing fallow for a period of decades in order to allow regeneration through the regrowth of wild vegetation These food items can be supplemented through the raising of livestock hunting wild game and in many cases with the gathering of wild plants Miller 2005 Park 2006 Though periodic movement precludes absolute permanent ownership of land some horticultural societies fiercely defend current territories and practice violence against neighboring groups For instance Napoleon Chagnon 1997 depicts the Yanamamo of Venezuela and Brazil as the ‚ÄúFierce People‚Äù though others have been highly critical of Chagnon‚Äôs account of this society Horticulture can also produce a broad diet and in some cases more food per unit of land area than foraging Though populations of horticulturalists tend to have greater density than those of foragers they are generally less dense than those which practice other modes of production If practiced on a small scale over a large area with long fallow periods horticulture has less negative environmental impact than agriculture or industrialism but more than foraging Miller 2005 Generally horticulture coincides with a subsistence type of economy in terms of production distribution Pastoralism defined as reliance on products from livestock coupled with a seasonal nomadic herding tradition is similar to horticulture in that it is extensive in its use of land area Social groups in pastoral societies tend to have similar numbers and population density to horticultural societies Pastoral societies often trade animal products with agricultural societies for plant based foods to augment their diet Frequent movement often means that pastoralism has a similar environmental impact to horticulture though instances of overgrazing and consequent land degradation see later subsection under Globalization and Nutrition have been sited in some cases Pastoralism generally entails a greater reliance on meat or other animal products such as milk or blood than other modes of production This mode of production has a similar use rights profile to shifting cultivation Traditionally pastoralism has coincided with a subsistence based economy but in the last several decades some pastoralist societies such as Mongolia have herded animals and practiced nomadic living patterns but have produced livestock primarily for market exchange Agriculture sometimes referred to as intensive agriculture involves clearing and using the same plot of land for an extended period sometimes several generations it also involves the use of plows and draft animals in the preparation of land for planting and the cultivation of crops Agriculture often supports much higher population densities than other modes of production except industrialism and agricultural societies can range in population from a few thousand into the millions Though agriculture produces more food per unit of land area than the previously mentioned modes the tendency of agricultural societies to focus on relatively few crops has often meant that these societies have much less diverse diets than foraging and horticultural societies There is some archaeological and fossil evidence that populations in transition from foraging to agriculture have tended to suffer reduced stature reduced musculature and to exhibit other markers of malnutrition Research has suggested that agriculture paradoxically allows a higher but less healthy population for a given area The advent of agriculture has marked that advent of social stratification in many parts of the world with marked differentials in access to resources between segments of the same society This mode of production also is more likely to entail permanent individual or family ownership of particular tracts of land than previously mentioned modes of production Agriculture has cooccurred with both subsistence and market economies often with a single society exhibiting some degree of both types of economies and has a more negative impact on the environment than the aforementioned modes of production Industrialism combines agriculture with mechanized industrial production of goods through the use of fossil fuels Additionally industrial societies use mechanized equipment in order to prepare land for planting harvest crops and distribute food to locations distant from where the original crops were planted Industrialism shows similar trends to agriculture in terms of population density and environmental impact except to a much greater degree Dietary diversity can be highly variable under an industrial mode of production and can depend on access to foods produced for local subsistence on the one hand or to income level and purchasing power visa vie foods available in food markets Leatherman and Goodman 2005 Dietary diversity and nutritional health often correlate with the degree of social stratification within an industrial society and sometimes between societies With the exception of Soviet model states industrial societies are heavily based on the concept of private property rights and the accumulation of profit through ‚Äúfree enterprise‚Äù The general trend for many societies over the past several millennia has been toward agriculture and in the past two centuries toward industrialism Though these two modes of production are by no means superior to other modes in every respect the fact that societies that practice them tend to have larger populations higher population densities and a more complex social structure has correlated with the geographic expansion of agricultural and industrial societies at the expense of societies emphasizing other modes of production Concurrent with this trend toward intensified agricultural and industrial production has been the rise of the social and economic paradigm of capitalism which entails the production and sale of goods and services in the market place in order to produce a profit These trends have had profound implications for nutritional status for human beings on a global scale In order to discern how broader economic and environmental trends affect a community‚Äôs food systems food security and nutritional status it is important to summarize one of the most significant economic and ecological phenomena today globalization The next section will treat the linkages between economic and ideological trends over the last several centuries and environmental and political economic factors affecting access to food and nutritional status Globalization and nutrition General summary of globalization Though the scope and dimensions of globalization as most people currently construe it are of fairly recent origin the broader phenomenon of global interconnections through cultural diffusion and trade is several centuries old Starting in the late Fifteenth century European powers expanded beyond the European subcontinent to found colonies in the Americas East Asia South Asia Australia and Oceania This expansion has had a profound impact in terms of wealth creation in Europe and extraction elsewhere cultural changes in most of the world‚Äôs societies and biological phenomena such as the introduction of several infectious diseases into the Western Hemisphere which caused tremendous disruption and population reduction for indigenous societies there These events far from occurring coincidentally have had synergistic relationships in one vivid example the decimation of Amerindian populations through infectious disease often preceding and facilitating subsequent conquest by European powers Such conquests in turn have often had significantly negative impacts on internal cohesion ability of populations to attain adequate resources for their own subsistence and traditional social obligations and local environments for colonized societies In order to understand the effects of globalization on nutritional status and food security it is important to understand the historical circumstances that have led to contemporary globalization and that still manifest themselves in political social material and physicalhealth differentials between and within the different peoples of the world today ‚ÄúThe Rise of the Merchant Industrialist and Capital Controller‚Äù written by Richard Robbins in 2005 uses a hypothetical scenario of the reader as a ‚Äúmerchant adventurer‚Äù to detail economic world history starting in 1400 In 1400 China was arguably the most cosmopolitan and technologically complex society in the world It was a center of trade along with the Middle East East Africa and ports on the Mediterranean Sea Western Europe while playing a part in this network did not dominate it by any means one could argue for European marginalization in fact This circumstance began to change when the Europeans ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù the Americas setting in motion a process that would disrupt many societies and devastate indigenous populations of the Western Hemisphere The dominant economic paradigm of this period was mercantilism whereby European merchants began to achieve power in world markets and in relation to European governing aristocracies Robbins cites example of government protections that facilitated mercantilism in the form of exclusive proprietary rights to trading companies and armies used to protect trade by force if necessary He details instances of government protection such as the example of how Great Britain destroyed Indias textile industry and turned that society into an importer of textiles is especially illustrative In dealing with imperialism capitalism and the rise of corporations Robins further details the manner in which the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù transformed various regionspeoples from proactive participants on global trade networks into sources of raw materials and consumers of European or North American exports This history of world trade is important to the consideration of current issues of disparity of power and wealth There are many critiques the policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF in the promotion of high intensity capital investment in developing nations eg Weller et al 2001 Fort et al 2004 Disparities within nations and growing poverty rates in many nations also provide compelling evidence of the idea that the rewards of economic globalization are uneven at best There is a great deal of literature about globalization and increases in health disparities both between and within countries Finally there is Amartya Sen with Development as Freedom 1999 here Sen disagrees about whether or not the world‚Äôs poor are getting poorer but also maintains that this criterion is not the most important He argues that relative disparities and power differentials are the most important problems of globalization Sen states that the increasing interconnection of the Worlds societies can have positive benefits but that the disparities and opportunities for exploitation must be mitigated to the greatest extent possible if they can not be eliminated outright Sen provides groundwork for a nuanced middle ground between unabashed proponents and opponents of globalization Far from being universally decried the recent accelerated expansion of western capitalism geographically politically and ideologically has been lauded in many quarters International and bilateral agencies such as the World Bank IMF and the United States Agency for International Development USAID have utilized free market capitalist theories extensively in development programs in many corners of the globe whose state aims are to promote economic growth for communities and nationstates and to alleviate poverty Likewise prominent individuals such as former US Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan and US based journalist Thomas Friedman have held forth extensively about the possibilities of economic and social improvement in developed and developing nations alike mainly through increased access to appropriate education sophisticated communications and transportation technology and a paradigm of social and economic ‚Äúflexibility‚Äù where individuals and communities who can best adapt to rapid changes in the role of governments and the particular economic base of a given location would be in the best position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by economic political and cultural globalization This free market ideology is also predominant in the policies and procedures of the World Trade Organization WTO and many transnational corporations TNC‚Äôs most of which are headquartered in developed nations The rise of Capitalism and the free market society have indeed increased and exacerbated food insecurity in the worlds poor due to the structure and function of a Capitalist society where only those who can afford to buy food to feed themselves are the only ones with access to a secure and adequate food supply Food is no longer a human right to life and health due to the Capitalist approach to commodifying food in the free market society that as a result of globalization has spread all over the world Transnational corporations and trade organizations such as NAFTA facilitate this approach of commodifying our worlds food supply by enforcing laws and regulations which further deepen the inequality of wealth and unequal distribution of common goods such as food between the rich and the poor In contrast to the ‚Äúwestern‚Äù economic model most early social scholarship about economics stressed the predominance of reciprocity as a primary driving force in traditional nonWestern societies Marcel Mauss referred to the gift as a ‚Äútotal social phenomenon‚Äù fraught with ritual and socio political as well as material significance Though some objects such as armbands or shell necklaces in the kula ring that runs through several island groups off the coast of Papua New Guinea might induce some form of prestige based competition the terms of exchange are significantly different than a monetary transaction under a modern capitalist system While Appadurai actually describes ritual objects as a type of commodity he couches them as such under significantly different terms than the marketbased types of commodity normally treated by economists Annette Wiener criticizes earlier works in anthropology and sociology that depicted ‚Äúsimple‚Äù societies utilizing a simple version of reciprocity Whatever the theoretical stance of social scholars on nonwestern traditional economies there is a consensus that such essentials as food and water tended to be shared more freely than other types of goods or services This dynamic tends to change with the introduction of a marketbased economy into a society with food coming to be increasingly treated as a commodity rather than a social good or an essential component of health and survival Regardless of one‚Äôs overall perspective on the costs and benefits of economic globalization there are several examples in social scholarship of groups of people suffering a decline in nutritional statues subsequent to the introduction of a capitalist marketbased economy into an area that has previously practiced an economy based more on subsistence production and reciprocity Although some people‚Äôs food security may improve with access to more steady income many people in communities that have heretofore practiced a subsistence economy may experienced greater food insecurity and nutritional status due to insufficient income to replace the foods no longer produced by a household Whether the growth of food insecurity and socioeconomic disparities in many parts of the world in recent decades is an inherent part of globalization or a temporary ‚Äúgrowing pain‚Äù until economic development attains its full efficacy is a matter of debate but there are many empirical examples of communities being dissociated from traditional means of food production and not being able to find sufficient wages in a new market economy to achieve a balanced and calorically sufficient diet Several factors affecting food security and nutritional status range on a continuum from more physical phenomena such as land degradation and land expropriation to more culturally and sociopolitically driven things such as cash cropping dietary delocalization and commoditization of food one important caveat is that all of these trends are interconnected and fall under a broad category of sociocultural and economic disruptions and dislocations under the current paradigm of globalization Land degradation Though Blakie and Brookfield acknowledge the problematic aspects of defining land degradation with definitional variation depending in large part on the scholar or stakeholder in question they do outline a general idea of reduced soil fertility and reduced ability of a given area of land to provide for people‚Äôs subsistence needs as compared to earlier periods in human history on that same land area Paul Farmer discusses the effects of land degradation in central Haiti on local people‚Äôs ability to produce sufficient food for their families within the environs of their own communities Farmer links malnutrition in a Haitian village with vulnerability to infectious diseases including tuberculosis and HIVAIDS both in terms of chance of infection and severity of symptoms for those infected While the extremely low percentage of the US population involved in agriculture strongly suggests that direct access to arable land is not an absolute necessity for food security and nutritional health land degradation in many developing nations is accelerating the rate of rural to urban migration at a more accelerated rate than most major cities are equipped to handle Leatherman and Goodman also allude to land degradation cooccurring with decreases in food security and nutritional status in some communities in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo Walter Edgar discusses the correlation between land degradation and economic disruption as well as nutritional hardship in the US state of South Carolina in the decades following the Reconstruction Period Coupled with land expropriation land degradation has the effect of thrusting unprepared subsistence producers or other peasant farmers into a fastpaced and complex market economy heavily influence by policy makers who are far removed from the concerns and worldview of small scale farmers in developing countries Land expropriation Occurring for a variety of reasons land expropriation or the disruption of traditional ownership of land by more powerful interests such as local elites governments or transnational corporations can also markedly affect nutritional status Robbins details examples in Mexico of peasants facing land expropriation in the face of agribusiness consolidation under the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA in many cases these subsistence producers are forced either to migrate to cities or work sporadically as agricultural labors Since most if not all food must be purchased under these circumstances the food security and nutritional status of these newer additions to the pool of poor unskilled labor often declines Another common impetus for expropriation is nonagricultural ‚Äúeconomic development‚Äù often in the form of tourism In one Example Donald MacLeod details curtailment of subsistence activities mainly fishing and cultivation in areas of the Canary Islands in the face of pressures from tourism interests wishing to monopolize the ‚Äúpristine‚Äù beauty of locations catering to Germans and other tourists from EU nations Ironically local people see relatively little monetary benefit from the rise in tourism as many vacations are planned by German tour companies linked with all inclusive German owned resorts in the Canary Islands and are paid for before tourists ever arrive at their vacation destination Leatherman and Goodman and Daltabuit point to circumscription of land available for traditional milpa horticultural production in communities in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo in the face of growing demands for land for resorts by tourism interests under the auspices of the Mexican national government One expropriation scenario with a long history is cash cropping where 8–∑765–µ46—â–∑09—Ö9–∑crops grown for revenue from exports are prioritized over crops grown for local consumption Cash cropping In Sweetness and Power written by Sidney Mintz in 1985 details examples of monocropping or planting massive areas with one cash crop in several Caribbean Islands including Cuba He states that Cuba went from being an economically diverse place with many small scale subsistence producers to a monocrop plantation system dependent on cash from its sugar crop and substantial food imports for the later centuries of the Spanish Colonial Period He describes Cuba as an example of growing impoverishment and malnutrition concurrent with increasing concentration of land and other resources in fewer hands Gross and Underwood illustrate the mid Twentieth Century example of the advent of sisal production in Northeastern Brazil These authors detail a vicious cycle of the unfulfilled promises of sisal production for smallholders because owners of sisal processing machines did not think small farms worth their time small holders could not process and sell their sisal and were often forced to work as laborers on large farms Sisal is cited as being particularly insidious because it is hard to eradicate once introduced and makes subsequent subsistence production virtually impossible This article treats a common situation of households prioritizing working males in food allocation exposing growing children to malnutrition particularly under nutrition and micronutrient deficiency and all of its attendant ills Edgar discusses how exclusive planting of cotton in the Southeastern United States during the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries caused substantial land degradation lead to a great deal of land expropriation from small scale farmers and occurred in a context of widespread malnutrition Especially in Today‚Äôs complex accelerated version of globalization cash cropping is intimately linked with the delocalization of diets and the commoditization of food and has profound though varied implications for food security and nutritional status Delocalization and commoditization In ‚ÄúDiet and Delocalization Dietary Challenges since 1750‚Äù Pelto and Pelto trace the concurrent historical development of global capitalism and dietary delocalization a process in which increasing portions of diet for a household or community come from an increasing distance away from that same community Nutritional scholars explicitly state that delocalization does not necessarily entail increased food insecurity and malnutrition but that access to an adequate diet becomes increasingly removed from local control and increasingly contingent on access to hard cash or some other nonfood precious resource Leatherman and Goodman discuss the ironic result of their study in Quintana Roo that both the groups with the best and worst food security and nutritional status worked in service industries related to tourism with the median group being a milpa community They differentiate between those with stable employment and income who have access to a wide variety of foods on a regular basis and those with sporadic employment who struggle for caloric sufficiency within the household and have low dietary diversity The main import of these examples is not that delocalization is universally negative but that it tends to increase disparities of food security and nutritional status within and between social groups with some segments suffering marked degradation of both Closely linked with delocalization is food commoditization or the treatment of food primarily as a market commodity rather than prioritizing other uses such as sustenance human rights entitlement or social relations Dewey describes the deleterious effects of food commoditization for rural communities in Central America to include reductions in food security and nutritional status Much of tourism literature details marked increases in the commoditization of food subsequent to the introduction of tourism as a form of market based economic development Dewey and Robbins also state that when food is primarily seen as a commodity by powerful interests not only does such an ideology increase delocalization but also land degradation and expropriation as elite land owners or transnational corporations cause massive social and ecological disruptions in the process of monocropping food crops over broad swaths of land in order to reap maximum profits from overseas sales Indeed delocalization and commoditization have significant potential to diminish food security and nutritional status in poor communities over broad areas of the world Dietary health In terms of food security and dietary diversity which are defined as reliable access to a caloric sufficiency and access to a wide variety of macro and micro nutrients in order to maintain nutritive balance respectively the commoditization of food plays a key role in diminishing the control local populations have over their own subsistence production Delocalization of food systems which Pelto and Pelto define as taking production of food out of a local subsistence context and tying it to geographically broader market systems can precipitate marked cultural and nutritional disruption Likewise commoditization of food systems defined as a paradigm shift from one of subsistence or social significances shift toward one which treats food primarily as a market commodity can affect dietary health as well as collective identity Commoditization tends to shift food security and dietary diversity away from integrated kinship or other reciprocal distribution networks toward being an issue of who can best compete in a free market to achieve these ends indeed commoditization has often been linked to breakdowns in food entitlements which are defined as cultural or social norms that ensure food access for all members of a given social group The deleterious effects of mild to moderate malnutrition MMM not only pertain to caloric insufficiency often closely associated with food insecurity but also to poor dietary diversity in particular curtailed access to protein complex carbohydrates zinc iron and other micronutrients The ways in which undernutrition and micronutrient deficiency interact with other health effects are myriad The most obvious manifestation of MMM stunting is defined as height and or weight below the standard range for a particular age group However far from being a mere difference in height and weight stunting was correlated with a wide variety of health effects Closely related to stunting level of physical activity closely articulates with nutritional status and affects childhood development Chronically malnourished infants and toddlers showed decreased physical activity compared to supplemented groups or those who are adequately nourished Perhaps the most critical facets of human development correlated to nutrition levels are behavior and cognition development in these two areas could have profound effects on life chances for individuals and populations In comparing a group of southern Mexican children subject to MMM and a group in the same region who received dietary supplements Chavez et al show a relation between MMM and poorer school performance unsupplemented children showed poorer participation greater degree of inclass distraction more sleeping in class and poorer performance on standardized tests In addition malnourished children showed poorer scores on intelligence quotient IQ tests than their supplemented counterparts Of all the aspects of human existence sexual reproduction may have the most detailed articulation with malnutrition In populations subject to MMM menarche occurs later 155 years than in adequately nourished populations an early average menopause 405 years makes for a relatively short reproductive period for women in the study area for Chavez et al Because of longer postpartum periods of amenorrhea birth spacing was an average of 27 months versus 19 months Though longer birth spacing can help control population growth the evidence that Chavez et al present suggest a curtailing of reproductive choice and adaptability due to malnutrition This study also linked maternal MMM with higher infant and young child mortality Another effect of MMM crucial to life chances is work capacity MMM shows a cyclical pattern of decreasing work capacity and its rewards further exacerbating the problem Allen found a correlation between reduced VO2 max rates among MMM populations and decreased muscular strength and endurance in the performance of strenuous manual labor Although personal motivation can have a strong positive impact on individual work performance better muscular development associated with a history of adequate nutrition increases overall work capacity irrespective of effort Among Jamaican cane cutters those within normal size range cut more cane than those who showed stunting One cultural variation in this trend was found among MMM Guatemalan workers who put forth work effort comparable to better nourished counterparts but were likely to engage in resting behavior than in recreational or social activity during off hours In wage economies where workers get paid in proportion to productive output reduced work capacity can translate to reduced food security increasing the risk of MMM Additionally malnutrition and infectious disease have a synergistic relationship that can lead to spiraling health deterioration According to Allen the incidence of infectious disease does not vary significantly between MMM and adequately nourished populations but the duration and severity of disease episodes is greater for MMM populations A key reason for this disparity is that infectious disease often results in poor food intake and nutrient absorption Not only do sick people generally eat little but what they do eat is often of minimal benefit due to nausea and diarrhea Aside from MMM due to undernutrition or micronutrient deficiency overnutrition defined as the consumption of too many calories for one‚Äôs body size and physical activity level is also becoming an increasingly significant problem for much of the World Overnutrition has been associated with obesity which the USDA and McEwen and Seeman correlate with increased risk of type II diabetes cardiovascular disease and stroke Overnutrition is also often associated with the cooccurrence of caloric sufficiency or oversufficiency and micronutrient deficiency as is often the case where processed foods that are high in calories but low in most nutrients increase in dietary prominence Leatherman and Goodman and Guest and Jones discuss the growing coincidence of stunting and other symptoms of MMM and obesity within developing nations sometimes within the same community This trend can be linked to changing economies and food practices in much of the World under contemporary economic globalization Notes  References Allen Lindsay H 1984 Functional Indications of Nutritional Status of the Whole

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutritional gatekeeper has been used to refer to the person in a household who typically makes the purchasing and preparation decisions related to food Nutritional gatekeepers can be a parent grandparent sibling or caregiver Traditionally a role played by women today the role of nutritional gatekeeper is not part of any gender role    History The concept of the nutritional gatekeeper was first suggested by Kurt Lewin in 1943 Before that time most past efforts to study nutrition education had focused on the individuals eating the food Based on Lewin‚Äôs research food reaches the household through ‚Äúchannels‚Äù such as grocery store the garden and the refrigerator The selection of the channels and the food that passes through them is under control of the gatekeeper For sixtyfive years since Lewin‚Äôs work many dietetics and nutrition textbooks have referred in the discussions of children‚Äôs and adolescents‚Äô dietary habits to the gatekeeper role played by women Home nutritional gatekeeper A home‚Äôs nutritional gatekeeper usually has the biggest food influence in the nutrition life of most people They are the biggest food influence in the lives of their children as well as in the life of their spouse or partner Regardless of the gatekeeper‚Äôs sex or age and regardless of whether they are a great cook or whether they are culinarily challenged the gatekeeper has a huge daytoday influence on his or her family‚Äôs nutrition An average of 72 of what and how much children eat is estimated to be either directly or indirectly determined by these nutritional gatekeepers In addition the gatekeeper has a direct and an indirect impact on what the children eat outside the home This happens every time they make their children‚Äôs lunches and every time they give them enough money to afford whatever lunch or snack they want They also influence the restaurant orders of their family by what they recommend or order themselves It has been demonstrated that children without regular family dinners ate sweets and fast foods more often and had more behavioral problems than those having regular family dinners Cooks as nutritional gatekeepers Gatekeeper research starting in the 1940s suggests that the cooks are also responsible for nutrition Cooking family dinners can expand the nutritional gatekeepers influence Eating family dinner has been associated with healthful dietary patterns better fruit and vegetable intake lower intake of fried food and soda Cooks are not only gatekeepers but opinion leaders as well Growing role of caregivers outside the home as nutritional gatekeeper Greater numbers of children are relying on caregivers to provide a significant portion of their nutritional needs or act as nutritional gatekeepers Currently child care in the United States is varied ‚Äì child care homes both regulated and unregulated ‚Äì and other placement such as care in the child‚Äôs home by a relative or other caregiver Providing healthful meals and snacks to children during the day and sometimes the early evening as well in a pleasant eating environment is a major responsibility for the child care facility In other words the child care facility have joined the family as the nutritional gatekeepers‚Äô As stated in BrileyMcbride amp RobertsGray 1997 Caregivers are being asked to take the role of the nutritional gatekeeper for children Government involvement  The USDA has taken note on the powerful influence of nutritional gatekeepers They have launched an initiative called ‚ÄúProject MOM‚Äù Mothers amp Others amp MyPyramid to help improve eating habits by focusing on the nutritional gatekeepers The idea behind the project is as follows If we can collectively connect with a family‚Äôs

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutritional genomics is a science studying the relationship between human genome nutrition and health It can be divided into two disciplines Nutrigenomics studies the effect of nutrients on health through altering genome proteome metabolome and the resulting changes in physiology Nutrigenetics studies the effect of genetic variations on the interaction between diet and health with implications to susceptible subgroups More specifically nutrigenetics studies how individual differences in genes influence the bodys response to diet and nutrition For example people with an enzyme deficiency caused by mutations in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase cannot metabolize foods containing the amino acid phenylalanine and must modify their diets to minimize consumption With modern genomic data severe gene mutations with less severe effects are being explored to determine whether dietary practices can be more closely personalized to individual genetic profiles However there have been few validated studies for these kinds of classical gene mutation effects    Genedietdisease interaction 97 of the genes known to be associated with human diseases result in monogenic diseases ie a mutation in one gene is sufficient to cause the disease Modifying the dietary intake can prevent some monogenic diseases One example is phenylketonuria a genetic disease characterized by a defective phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme which is normally responsible for the metabolism of phenylalanine to tyrosine This results in the accumulation of phenylalanine and its breakdown products in the blood and the decrease in tyrosine which increases the risk of neurological damage and mental retardation Phenylalaninerestricted tyrosinesupplemented diets are a means to nutritionally treat this monogenic disease In contrast many common diseases such as obesity cancer diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are polygenic diseases ie they arise from the dysfunction in a cascade of genes and not from a single mutated gene Dietary intervention to prevent the onset of such diseases is a complex and ambitious goal Recently it was discovered that the health effects of food compounds are related mostly to specific interactions on molecular level ie dietary constituents participate in the regulation of gene expression by modulating the activity of transcription factors or through the secretion of hormones that in turn interfere with a transcription factor Nutrigenomics Nutrigenomics refers to the prospective analysis of differences among nutrients in the regulation of gene expression ie it studies the effect of nutrients on the genome proteome and metabolome It involves the application of highthroughput genomic tools such as DNA microarray technology in nutrition research Nutrigenomics is a discovery science which aims at understanding how nutrition influences metabolic pathways and homeostatic control and how this regulation is disturbed in the early phase of a dietrelated disease Biomics technologies The recent advances in nutrigenomics studies are owed to the completion of human genome project and the new biomics technologies that provide means for the simultaneous determination of the expression of many thousands of genes at the mRNA transcriptomics metabolites metabolomics and protein proteomics levels Genomic and transcriptomic studies are mostly conducted by DNA microarray technologies Proteomics and metabolomics have no standardized procedures yet but usually proteome analysis is done by twodimensional gel electrophoresis and Liquid chromatographymass spectrometry while metabolome analysis is conducted through gas chromatographymass spectrometry liquid chromatographymass spectrometry and liquid chromatographynuclear magnetic resonance Usually these technologies are applied in a ‚Äúdifferential display‚Äù mode ie by comparing two situations eg diseased versus healthy in order to reduce the complexity in data by examining only differences Example of applications An example of the application of the nutrigenomic approach was a study that simultaneously identified a mechanism for the regulation of sterol uptake in the intestine and the basis for sitosterolemia a genetic disorder characterized by hyperabsorption of dietary sterols leading to hypercholesterolemia with a high risk of developing atherosclerosis In the study a group of mice was treated with a lipid metabolismaltering drug and DNA microarray technology was used for mRNA expression profiling of various tissues Differential display mode was used by comparing differences in expression levels with a control group of mice This led to the discovery of an unknown gene Through computer simulation techniques it was found that two proteins produced by the newly discovered gene were responsible for the regulated reverse transport of animal and plant dietary sterols out of the apical surface of intestinal cells By exploring human gene databases a human homologue of the mouse gene was identified This explained why dietary sterols which are structurally similar to cholesterol are not absorbed in normal individuals By scanning sitosterolemic individuals for this gene it was found that all of them had a mutation in this gene responsible for their uncontrolled hyperabsorption of dietary sterols Nutrigenetics Nutrigenetics is the retrospective analysis of genetic variations among individuals with respect to the interaction between diet and disease It is an applied science that studies how the genetic makeup of an individual affects the response to diet and the susceptibility to dietrelated diseases This necessitates the identification of gene variants associated with differential responses to nutrients and with higher susceptibility to dietrelated diseases The ultimate goal of nutrigenetics is to provide nutritional recommendations for individuals in what is known as personalized or individualized nutrition A number of companies have begun offering nutrigenetic testing but the recommendations are often highly generic and could provide a false sense of security As these companies are not offering specific clinical advice they do not qualify for regulation beyond the accuracy of the genetic test applied Objections to such testing kits in the UK have led to the voluntary suspension of commercial testing activity there and in the US severe criticisms have been leveled against various testing companies by the Government Accountability Office Applications A number of genetic variations have been shown to increase the susceptibility to dietrelated diseases These include variants that have been associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus obesity cardiovascular diseases some autoimmune diseases and cancers Nutrigenetics aims to study these susceptible genes and provide dietary interventions for individuals at risk of such diseases Some examples are shown below Nutrigenetics and Type 2 Diabetes mellitus A number of genes are involved in regulating lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity and thereby affecting the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus Among them is the gene responsible for sterol response element binding protein1c or SREBP1c a membranebound transcription factor which can directly activate the expression of several genes involved in the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol fatty acids triglycerides and phospholipids In mice models overexpression of SREBP1c led to fatty livers hypertriglyceridemia severe insulin resistance and finally type 2 diabetes mellitus Later SREBP1c was identified as a candidate gene in the regulation of human insulin resistance Two missense mutations in exons coding the aminoterminal transcriptional activating domain of SREBP1c were found in individuals displaying severe insulin resistance Another association was found between an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism CT between exons 18c and 19c and the onset of diabetes in men but not in women These studies suggest that mutations in SREBP1c may increase the sensitivity to developing diabetes Furthermore SREBP1c appears to be susceptible to diet and thus it can be a target for nutritional intervention Studies in mice have shown that SREBP1c mRNA expression was highly induced in mice having one polymorphism ‚Äì468 AG after the consumption of high fructose diets This implies that a single nucleotide polymorphism can also modulate the sensitivity of a gene to dietary intervention Nutrigenetics and cardiovascular diseases Hyperlipidemia is usually associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease Therapy includes lifestyle changes as alterations in the patients diet physical activity and treatment with pharmaceuticals such as statins However individuals respond differently to the treatment This was attributed to genetic variations within the population Genetic variations in genes encoding for apolipoproteins some enzymes and hormones can alter individual sensitivity to developing cardiovascular diseases Some of these variants are susceptible for dietary intervention for example Individuals with the E4 allele in the apolipoprotein E gene show higher lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol bad cholesterol levels with increased dietary fat intake compared with those with the other E1 E2 E3 alleles receiving equivalent amounts of dietary fat One single nucleotide polymorphism 75 GA in the apolipoprotein A1 gene in women is associated with an increase in High density lipoproteincholesterol levels with the increase in the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA Individuals with the A variant showed an increase in the protective HDL good cholesterol levels following an increased consumption of PUFA compared with those with the G variant taking similar amounts of PUFA One polymorphism 514 CC in the hepatic lipase gene is associated with an increase in protective HDL levels compared with the TT genotype common in certain ethnic groups such as AfricanAmericans in response to high fat diet Nutrigenetics and cancer Nutrients can contribute to the development of cancers especially colon gastric and breast cancer Several gene variants have been identified as susceptibility genes One example is the NAcetyltransferase NAT gene NAT is a phase II metabolism enzyme that exists in two forms NAT1 and NAT2 Several polymorphisms exist in NAT1 and NAT2 some of which have been associated with NAT capabilities of slow intermediate or fast acetylations NAT is involved in acetylation of heterocyclic aromatic amines found in heated products especially well cooked red meat During cooking of muscle meat at high temperature some amino acids may react with creatine to give heterocyclic aromatic amines HAA HAA can be activated through acetylation to reactive metabolites which bind DNA and cause cancers Only NAT2 fast acetylators can perform this acetylation Studies have shown that the NAT2 fast acetylator genotype had a higher risk of developing colon cancer in people who consumed relatively large quantities of red meat Academic

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutritional neuroscience is the scientific discipline that studies the effects various components of the diet such as minerals vitamins protein carbohydrates fats dietary supplements synthetic hormones and food additives have on neurochemistry neurobiology behavior and cognition Recent research on nutritional mechanisms and their effect on the brain show they are involved in almost every facet of neurological functioning including alterations in neurogenesis neurotrophic factors neural pathways and neuroplasticity throughout the life cycle Relatively speaking the brain consumes an immense amount of energy in comparison to the rest of the body The human brain is approximately 2 of the human body mass and uses 20‚Äì25 of the total energy expenditure Therefore mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function Insufficient intake of selected vitamins or certain metabolic disorders affect cognitive processes by disrupting the nutrientdependent processes within the body that are associated with the management of energy in neurons which can subsequently affect neurotransmission synaptic plasticity and cell survival    Minerals Deficiency or excess of essential minerals eg iron zinc copper and magnesium can disrupt brain development and neurophysiology to affect behavior Furthermore minerals have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers dementia Iron Iron is essential for several critical metabolic enzymes and a deficiency of this mineral can disrupt brain development For example chronic marginal iron affects dopamine metabolism and myelin fatty acid composition  and behavior in mice In rats a marginal iron deficiency that does not cause anemia disrupted axon growth in the auditory nerve affecting auditory brainstem latency without major changes in myelination In rhesus macaques prenatal iron deficiency disrupts emotional behavior  and polymorphisms that reduce the expression of monoamine oxidase interact with gestational iron deficiency to exacerbate the response to a stressful situation leading to increased aggressiveness Inexpensive and effective iron supplementation is an available preventative strategy recommended by the World Health Organization However iron supplementation can exacerbate malaria infection Therefore individuals receiving iron supplementation in malariaendemic areas must be carefully monitored Zinc Zinc is essential for the structure and function of thousands of proteins critical for the function of every cell Zinc can also serve as a neurotransmitter in the brain thus a deficiency of this mineral can clearly disrupt development as well as neurophysiology For example zinc deficiency during early development impairs neurogenesis leading to memory impairments However zinc deficiency later in life can disrupt appetite and cause depression like behavior However it is important to consider copper intake relative to zinc supplementation because excess zinc can disrupt copper absorption Deficiency Conservative estimates suggest that 25 of the worlds population is at risk of zinc deficiency Hypozincemia is usually a nutritional deficiency but can also be associated with malabsorption diarrhea acrodermatitis enteropathica chronic liver disease chronic renal disease sicklecell disease diabetes malignancy pyroluria and other chronic illnesses It can also occur after bariatric surgery heavy metal exposure and tartrazine Zinc deficiency is typically the result of inadequate dietary intake of zinc disease states that promote zinc losses or physiological states that require increased zinc Populations that consume primarily plant based diets that are low in bioavailable zinc often have zinc deficiencies Diseases or conditions that involve intestinal malabsorption promote zinc losses Fecal losses of zinc caused by diarrhea are one contributing factor often common in developing countries Changes in intestinal tract absorbability and permeability due in part to viral protozoal and bacteria pathogens may also encourage fecal losses of zinc Physiological states that require increased zinc include periods of growth in infants and children as well as in mothers during pregnancy Anorexia  Zinc deficiency may cause a decrease in appetite which can degenerate into anorexia or anorexia nervosa Appetite disorders in turn cause malnutrition and notably inadequate zinc intake Anorexia itself is a cause of zinc deficiency thus leading to a vicious cycle the worsening of anorexia worsens the zinc deficiency A 1994 randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled trial showed that zinc 14\\xa0mg per day doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa Cognitive and motor function impairment Cognitive and motor function may also be impaired in zinc deficient children Zinc deficiency can interfere with many organ systems especially when it occurs during a time of rapid growth and development when nutritional needs are high such as during infancy In animal studies rats who were deprived of zinc during early fetal development exhibited increased emotionality poor memory and abnormal response to stress which interfered with performance in learning situations Zinc deprivation in monkeys showed that zinc deficient animals were emotionally less mature and also had cognitive deficits indicated by their difficulty in retaining previously learned problems and in learning new problems Human observational studies show weaker results Low maternal zinc status has been associated with less attention during the neonatal period and worse motor functioning In some studies supplementation has been associated with motor development in very low birth weight infants and more vigorous and functional activity in infants and toddlers Plasma zinc level has been associated with many psychological disorders However the nature of this relationship remains unclear in most instances An increasing amount of evidence suggests that zinc deficiency could play a causal role in the etiology of depression Indeed zinc supplementation has been reported to improve measures of depression in randomized double blind placebo controlled trials Copper Copper is important for the function of many enzymes in the brain Notably dopamine Œ≤monooxygenase is affected by copper deficiency leading to increased dopamine and decreased norepinephrine levels Both copper deficiency and toxicity can interfere with brain development and function Deficiency The neurodegenerative syndrome of copper deficiency has been recognized for some time in ruminant animals in which it is commonly known as swayback The disease involves a nutritional deficiency in the trace element copper Copper is ubiquitous and daily requirement is low making acquired copper deficiency very rare Copper deficiency can manifest in parallel with vitamin B12 and other nutritional deficiencies The most common cause of copper deficiency is a remote gastrointestinal surgery such as gastric bypass surgery due to malabsorption of copper or zinc toxicity On the other hand Menkes disease is a genetic disorder of copper deficiency involving a wide variety of symptoms that is often fatal Neurological presentation Copper deficiency can cause a wide variety of neurological problems including myelopathy peripheral neuropathy and optic neuropathy Myelopathy Sufferers typically present difficulty walking gait difficulty caused by sensory ataxia irregular muscle coordination due to dorsal column dysfunction or degeneration of the spinal cord myelopathy Patients with ataxic gait have problems balancing and display an unstable wide walk They often feel tremors in their torso causing side way jerks and lunges In brain MRI there is often an increased T2 signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with myelopathy caused by copper deficiency T2 signalling is often an indicator of some kind of neurodegeneration There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord the cervical cord or sometimes both Copper deficiency myelopathy is often compared to subacute combined degeneration SCD Subacute combined degeneration is also a degeneration of the spinal cord but instead vitamin B12 deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging Peripheral neuropathy Another common symptom of copper deficiency is peripheral neuropathy which is numbness or tingling that can start in the extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience amp Rehabilitation ACNR published case report a 69yearold patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist vibration sensation was lost in the sternum and markedly reduced proprioception or sensation about the self‚Äôs orientation Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest Optic neuropathy Some patients suffering from copper deficiency have shown signs of vision and color loss The vision is usually lost in the peripheral views of the eye The bilateral vision loss is usually very gradual An optical coherence tomography OCT shows some nerve fiber layer loss in most patients suggesting the vision loss and color vision loss was secondary to optic neuropathy or neurodegeneration Toxicity Copper toxicity can occur from excessive supplement use eating acid foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware exposure to excess copper in drinking water or as the result of an inherited metabolic disorder in the case of Wilsons disease A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions such as hydroxyl radical in a manner similar to Fenton chemistry This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed oxidative stress and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity Some of the effects of aging may be associated with excess copper In addition studies have found that people with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia had heightened levels of copper in their systems However it is unknown at this stage whether the copper contributes to the mental illness whether the body attempts to store more copper in response to the illness or whether the high levels of copper are the result of the mental illness Alzheimer‚Äôs disease Elevated free copper levels exist in Alzheimers disease Copper and zinc are known to bind to amyloid beta proteins in Alzheimers disease This bound form is thought to mediate the production of reactive oxygen species in the brain A preliminary clinical trial suggests that zinc supplementation may be able to decrease copper levels and slow degeneration in Alzheimers disease Manganese Manganese is a component of some enzymes and stimulates the development and activity of other enzymes Manganese superoxide dismutase MnSOD is the principal antioxidant in mitochondria Several enzymes activated by manganese contribute to the metabolism of carbohydrates amino acids and cholesterol Deficiency of manganese causes skeletal deformation in animals and inhibits the production of collagen in wound healing On the other hand manganese toxicity is associated with neurological complications Toxicity Manganese poisoning is a toxic condition resulting from chronic exposure to manganese and first identified in 1837 by James Couper Presentation Chronic exposure to excessive Mn levels can lead to a variety of psychiatric and motor disturbances termed manganism Generally exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5\\xa0mg Mnm3 can lead to Mninduced symptoms In initial stages of manganism neurological symptoms consist of reduced response speed irritability mood changes and compulsive behaviors Upon protracted exposure symptoms are more prominent and resemble those of idiopathic Parkinsons disease as which it is often misdiagnosed although there are particular differences in both the symptoms nature of tremors for example response to drugs such as levodopa and affected portion of the basal ganglia Symptoms are also similar to Lou Gehrigs disease and multiple sclerosis Causes Manganism has become an active issue in workplace safety as it has been the subject of numerous product liability lawsuits against manufacturers of arc welding supplies In these lawsuits welders have accused the manufacturers of failing to provide adequate warning that their products could cause welding fumes to contain dangerously high manganese concentrations that could lead welders to develop manganism Companies employing welders are also being sued for what colloquially is known as welders disease However studies fail to show any link between employment as a welder and manganism or other neurological problems Manganism is also documented in reports of illicit methcathinone manufacturing This is due to manganese being a byproduct of methcathinone synthesis if potassium permanganate is used as an oxidiser Symptoms include apathy bradykinesia gait disorder with postural instability and spastichypokinetic dysarthria Another street drug sometimes contaminated with manganese is the socalled Bazooka prepared by freebase methods from cocaine using manganese carbonate Reports also mention such sources as contaminated drinking water and fuel additive methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl MMT which on combustion becomes partially converted into manganese phosphates and sulfate that go airborne with the exhaust and manganese ethylenebisdithiocarbamate Maneb a pesticide Pathological mechanisms Manganese may affect liver function but the threshold of acute toxicity is very high On the other hand more than 95 of manganese is eliminated by biliary excretion Any existing liver damage may slow this process increasing its concentration in blood plasma The exact neurotoxic mechanism of manganese is uncertain but there are clues pointing at the interaction of manganese with iron zinc aluminum and copper Based on a number of studies disturbed iron metabolism could underlie the neurotoxic action of manganese It participates in Fenton reactions and could thus induce oxidative damage a hypothesis corroborated by the evidence from studies of affected welders A study of the exposed workers showed that they have significantly fewer children This may indicate that longterm accumulation of manganese affects fertility Pregnant animals repeatedly receiving high doses of manganese bore malformed offspring significantly more often compared to controls Manganism mimics Schizophrenia It is found in large quantities in paint and steelmaking Treatment The current mainstay of manganism treatment is levodopa and chelation with EDTA Both have limited and at best transient efficacy Replenishing the deficit of dopamine with levodopa has been shown to initially improve extrapyramidal symptoms but the response to treatment goes down after 2 or 3 years with worsening condition of the same patients noted even after 10 years since last exposure to manganese Enhanced excretion of manganese prompted by chelation therapy brings its blood levels down but the symptoms remain largely unchanged raising questions about efficacy of this form of treatment Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity characterized by the reversal of Mnreduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase LDH leakage Locations The Red River Delta near Hanoi has high levels of manganese or arsenic in the water Approximately 65 percent of the region‚Äôs wells contain high levels of arsenic manganese selenium and barium This was also published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Magnesium Magnesium is necessary for the function of many metabolic enzymes and also serves as a key regulator of calcium channels involved in neurotransmission eg NMDA receptor Magnesium supplementation facilitates nerve regeneration after injury Although unpolished grains contain magnesium phytic acid in grains can inhibit its absorption Leafy greens are an excellent source of magnesium Vitamins Deficiency or excess intake of many vitamins can affect the brain contributing to developmental  and degenerative diseases Vitamin A Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for mammals which takes form in either retinol or the provitamin betaCarotene It helps regulation of cell division cell function genetic regulation helps enhance the immune system and is required for brain function chemical balance growth and development of the central nervous system and vision Learning memory In an experiment by Chongqing Medical University pregnant rats were either plentiful in vitamin A or were of a vitamin A deficiency VAD due to their diet The offspring of these rats were then tested in a water maze at 8 weeks old and it was found the VAD offspring had a harder time finishing the maze which helps show that these rats even while having a deficiency from in utero have more problems with learning memory Young rats in a separate study by the same university also showed impaired longterm potentiation in the hippocampus when they were VAD which shows neuronal impairment When the patient is VAD for too long the effects of the damage to the hippocampus can be irreversible Spatial memory Vitamin A affects spatial memory most of the time because the size of the nuclei in hippocampal neurons are reduced by approximately 70 when there is a deficiency which affects a persons abilities for higher cognitive function In a study by the University of Cagliari Italy VAD rats had more trouble learning a Radial arm maze than rats who had normal levels of the vitamin The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve it Here it was found that the retinoid receptors which help transport vitamin A were of normal function Prevention treatment and symptoms Eating foods high in vitamin A or taking dietary supplements retinol or retinal will prevent a deficiency The foods highest in vitamin A are any pigmented fruits and vegetables and leafy green vegetables also provide betaCarotene There can be symptoms of fat loss and a reduction of any weight gain that would be considered normal for an individual especially developmental weight gains such as in infants which would occur if the infant was deprived of vitamin A in utero andor if it was deprived postnatal for an extensive period of time The deficiency can also cause conditions such as blindness or night blindness also known as nyctalopia Night blindness is due to the inability to regenerate rhodopsin in the rods which is needed in dim light in order to see properly A treatment of supplements of retinoic acid which is a part of vitamin A can help replenish levels and help bring learning to normal but after 39 weeks this is ineffective even if the treatment is daily because it will not bring the retinoid hyposignalling back to normal Relationship with zinc Zinc is needed to maintain normal vitamin A levels in blood plasma It also helps vitamin A become metabolized by the liver However evidence suggests that when someone is deficient in both vitamin A and zinc memory is more improved when just vitamin A is increased than when just zinc is increased Of course memory has the largest improvement when both are increased When one of these nutrients is not balanced the other is most likely to be affected because they rely on each other for proper functioning in learning Thiamin vitamin B1 Vitamin B1 also known as thiamine is a coenzyme essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates This vitamin is important for the facilitation of glucose use thus ensuring the production of energy for the brain and normal functioning of the nervous system muscles and heart Thiamine is found in all living tissues and is uniformly distributed throughout mammalian nervous tissue including the brain and spinal cord Metabolism and coenzyme function of the vitamin suggest a distinctive function for thiamin within the nervous system The brain retains its thiamine content in the face of a vitamindeficient diet with great tenacity as it is the last of all nervous tissues studied to become depleted A 50 reduction of thiamine stores in rats becomes apparent after only 4 days of being put on a thiaminedeficient diet However polyneuritic signs do not begin to appear until about 4 or 5 weeks have passed Similar results have been found in human subjects Deficiencies The body has only small stores of B1 accordingly there is risk of deficiency if the level of intake is reduced only for a few weeks Thiamin deficiency during critical periods of early development can disrupts neurogenesis in animal models Lack of thiamin later in life causes the disease known as beriberi There are two forms of beriberi wet and dry Dry beriberi is also known as cerebral beriberi Characteristics of wet beriberi include prominent edema and cardiac involvement whereas dry beriberi is mainly characterized by a polyneuritis Severe thiamin deficiency can also result in acute neurodegeneration leading to peripheral neuropathy and memory loss In industrialized nations thiamine deficiency is a clinically significant problem in individuals with chronic alcoholism or other disorders that interfere with normal ingestion of food Thiamine deficiency within developed nations tends to manifest as Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome Chronic alcoholism can disrupt thiamin absorption and thiamin deficiency contributes to neurodegeneration and memory loss in alcoholics known as Wernickes encephalopathy Individuals with chronic alcoholism may fall short on minimum daily requirements of thiamine in part due to anorexia erratic eating habits lack of available food or a combination of any of these factors Thiamine deficiency has been reported in up to 80 of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake reduced absorption and impaired utilization of thiamine Alcohol in combination with its metabolite acetaldehyde interacts with thiamine utilization at the molecular level during transport diphosphorylation and modification processes For this reason chronic alcoholics may have insufficient thiamine for maintenance of normal brain function even with seemingly adequate dietary intake Symptoms Clinical signs of B1 deficiency include mental changes such as apathy decrease in shortterm memory confusion and irritability Moderate deficiency in thiamine may reduce growth in young populations in increase chronic illness in both young and middleaged adults In addition moderate deficiency of thiamine may increase rates of depression dementia falls and fractures in old age The lingering symptoms of neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi are known as Korsakoffs syndrome or the chronic phase of WernickeKorsakoffs Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder resulting from a deficiency in thiamine sharing the same predominant features of cerebral beriberi as characterized by ocular abnormalities ataxia of gait a global state of confusion and neuropathy The state of confusion associated with Wernickes may consist of apathy inattention spatial disorientation inability to concentrate and mental sluggishness or restlessness Clinical diagnosis of Wernickes disease cannot be made without evidence of ocular disturbance yet these criteria may be too rigid Korsakoffs likely represents a variation in the clinical manifestation of Wernicke encephalophathy as they both share similar pathological origin Korsakoffs syndrome is often characterized by confabulation disorientation and profound amnesia Characteristics of the neuropathology are varied but generally consist of bilaterally symmetrical midline lesions of brainstem areas including the mammillary bodies thalamus periaqueductal region hypothalamus and the cerebellar vermis Treatment Immediate treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy involves the administration of intravenous thiamine followed with longterm treatment and prevention of the disorder through oral thiamine supplements alcohol abstinence and a balanced diet Improvements in brain functioning of chronic alcoholics may occur with abstinencerelated treatment involving the discontinuation of alcohol consumption and improved nutrition Wernickes encephalopathy is lifethreatening if left untreated However a rapid reversal of symptoms may result from prompt administration of thiamine Prevention Fortification of flour is practiced in some countries to replace the thiamine lost during processing However this method has been criticized for missing the target population of chronic alcoholics who are most at risk for deficiency Alternative solutions have suggested the fortification of alcoholic beverages with thiamine Ingesting a diet rich in thiamine may stave off the adverse effects of deficiency Foods providing rich sources of thiamine include unrefined grain products readytoeat cereals meat especially pork dairy products peanuts legumes fruits and eggs Niacin vitamin B3 Vitamin B3 also known as niacin includes both nicotinamide as well as nicotinic acid both of which function in many biological oxidization and reduction reactions within the body These functions include the biochemical degradation of carbohydrates fats and proteins Niacin is also involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol which are known mediators of brain biochemistry and in effect of cognitive function Sufficient niacin intake is either obtained from diet or synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan Deficiencies  Severe niacin deficiency typically manifests itself as the disease pellagra Synthesis of B3 from tryptophan involves vitamin B2 and B6 so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to niacin deficiency An excess of leucine an essential amino acid in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B3 deficiency Pellagra is most common to populations within developing countries in which corn is the dietary staple The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa This is in part due to the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains which is not readily absorbed into the human body The processes involved in making corn tortillas can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake Though pellagra predominantly occurs in developing countries sporadic cases of pellagra may be observed within industrialized nations primarily in chronic alcoholics and patients living with functional absorption complications Symptoms Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 Ds diarrhea dermatitis dementia and death Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache irritability poor concentration anxiety hallucinations stupor apathy psychomotor unrest photophobia tremor ataxia spastic paresis fatigue and depression Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalophathy characterized by confusion memory loss and psychosis Those afflicted with pellagra may undergo pathological alterations in the nervous system Findings may include demylenation and degeneration of various affected parts of the brain spinal cord and peripheral nerves Treatment Prognosis of deficiency is excellent with treatment Without pellagra will gradually progress and lead to death within 4‚Äì5 years often a result of malnutrition from prolonged diarrhea or complications as caused by concurrent infections or neurological symptoms Symptoms of pellagra can be cured with exogenous administration of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide Flushing occurs in many patients treated therapeutically with nicotinic acid and as a result nicotinamide holds more clinical value as it is not associated with the same uncomfortable flushing The adult dose of nicotinamide is 100\\xa0mg taken orally every 6 hours until resolution of major acute symptoms followed with oral administration of 50\\xa0mg every 8‚Äì12 hours until skin lesions heal For children treatment involves oral ingestion of 10‚Äì15\\xa0mg of nicotinamide depending on weight every 6hours until signs and symptoms are resolved Severe cases require 1\\xa0gram every 3‚Äì4 hours administered parenterally Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an overthecounter drug for the treatment of Alzheimers dementia Conversely no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers vascular or frontotemporal types This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellegra but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia Prevention The best method of prevention is to each food rich in B3 Generally this involves the intake of a proteinrich diet Foods that contain high concentrations of niacin in the free form include beans and organ meat as well as enriched grain and cereal products While niacin is present in corn and other grains the bioavailability of the nutrient is much less than it is in proteinrich sources Different methods of processing corn may result in a higher degree of bioavailability of the vitamin Though treatment with niacin does little to alter the effects of Alzheimers dementia niacin intake from foods is inversely associated with the disease Folate vitamin B9 Folate deficiency can disrupt neuralation and neurogenesis Maternal folic acid intake around the time of conception prevents neural tube defects Furthermore folic acid intake was recently associated with incidence of autism Enriched white flour is fortified with folic acid in the United States and many other countries However the European Union does not have mandatory folic acid fortification Although the protective effects of folic acid are well documented there remains legitimate concern that fortification could lead to toxic levels in a subset of the population For example elevated levels of folic acid can interact with vitamin B12 deficiency to cause neurodegeration Furthermore folic acid and iron can interact to exacerbate malaria Folic acid is the most oxidized and stable form of folate and can also be referred to as vitamin B9 It rarely occurs naturally in foods but it is the form used in vitamin supplements as well as fortified food products Folate coenzymes are involved in numerous conversion processes within the body including DNA synthesis and amino acid interconversions Folate and vitamin B12 play a vital role in the synthesis of Sadenosylmethionine which is of key importance in the maintenance and repairment of all cells including neurons In addition folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters Folate has a major but indirect role in activities which help to direct gene expression and cell proliferation These activities occur at a greatly increased rate during pregnancy and depend on adequate levels of folate within blood plasma Concentrations of blood plasma folate and homocysteine concentrations are inversely related such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration Thus dietary intake of folate is a major determinant of homocysteine levels within the body Autoantibodies against folate receptor alpha have been found in up to 75 of children with autism Deficiencies Folate deficiency most commonly arises from insufficient folate intake from the diet but may also stem from inefficient absorption or metabolic utilization of folate usually a result of genetic variation The relationship between folate and B12 is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in megaloblastic anemia characterized by organic mental change The process of neural tube transformation into structures that will eventually develop into the central nervous system is known as neurulation the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after conception and is completed by 28 days Thus a woman may not even be aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete potentially causing severe consequences in the development of the fetus Functional problems in the absorption and utilization of vitamins may also play a role in folate deficiencies within the elderly Symptoms  The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate and to a lesser extent vitamins B6 and B12 Elevated homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of vascular events as well as dementia Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B12 deficiency Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B12 generally results in peripheral neuropathy whereas folaterelated anemia often results in affective or mood disorders Neurological effects are not often associated with folaterelated megaloblastic anemia although demyelinating disorders may eventually present In one study mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B12 deficiency In addition folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups In addition depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard antidepressant therapy than did those with normal levels within plasma However replication of these findings are less robust The role of folic acid during pregnancy is vital to normal development of the nervous system in the fetus A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in neural tube disorder a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely NTDs are not to be confused with spina bifida which does not involve neural elements Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes encephalocele craniorachischisis and anencephaly In addition these defects can also be classified as open if neural tissue is exposed or covered only by membrane or can be classified as closed if the tissue is covered by normal skin Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in learning and memory particularly within the elderly population Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory Treatment Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin Indeed there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment In a 3year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50‚Äì70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800Œºg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma In addition to these results improvements of memory and informationprocessing speed as well as slight improvements of sensorimotor speed were observed which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance However while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels of folate as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect Prevention Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400Œºg of folic acid from fortified foods supplements or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85 with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy The incidence of Alzheimers and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food fortified or not and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease Good sources of folate include liver readytoeat breakfast cereals beans asparagus spinach broccoli and orange juice Choline Choline is an important methyl donor involved in onecarbon metabolism that also becomes incorporated into phospholipids and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine Because of its role in cellular synthesis choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain A study found that rats that were given supplements of choline in utero or in the weeks following birth had superior memories The changes appeared to be a result of physical changes to the hippocampus the area of the brain responsible for memory Furthermore choline can reduce some of the deleterious effects of folate deficiency on neurogenesis While choline during development is important adult levels of choline are also important Choline has been shown to increase the synthesis and release of acetylcholine from neurons which in turn increases memory A doubleblind study was conducted using normal college students no neurological disorders Results showed that twentyfive grams of phosphatidylcholine another form of choline created a significant improvement in explicit memory measured by a serial learning task however this improvement may be attributed to the improvement of slow learners Another study found that a single tengram oral dose of choline given to normal volunteers again without neurological disorders significantly decreased the number of trials needed to master a seriallearning word test This increase in memory is particularly beneficial to memory loss suffered by old age A study conducted on rats who like humans suffer from an agerelated loss of memory were tested on how choline affected memory The results showed that rats who had a chronic lowcholine diet showed greater memory loss then their sameage control counterparts while rats who had cholineenriched diets showed a diminished memory loss compared to both the cholinelow diet and control rat groups Furthermore young rats who were cholinedeficient performed as poorly on memory tasks as older rats while older rats that were given choline supplements performed as well as threemonthold rats Deficiencies and treatments Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men women and children are below the Adequate Intake levels It is important to note that not enough choline is naturally produced by the body so diet is an important factor People who consume a large quantity of alcohol may be at an increased risk for choline deficiency Sex and age also plays a role with premenopausal females being less sensitive to choline deficiency than either males or postmenopausal females This has been theorized to be a result of premenopausal women having an increased ability to synthesize choline in some form which has been confirmed in studies on rats In such instances of deficiency choline supplements or if able dietary changes may be beneficial Good sources of choline include liver milk eggs and peanuts There is further evidence to suggest that choline supplements can be used to treat people who suffer from neurological disorders as well we memory defects Oral doses of CDPcholine another form of choline given to elderly subjects with memory deficits but without dementia for four weeks showed improved memory in free recall tasks but not in recognition tests In a second study patients with early Alzheimertype dementia were treated with twentygive gram doses of phosphatidylcholine every day for six months Slightly improvements were shown in memory tests compared to the placebo control group It should be noted however that other studies conducted did not find any such improvement Cobalamin vitamin B12 Also known as cobalamin B12 is an essential vitamin necessary for normal blood formation It is also important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health The absorption of B12 into the body requires adequate amounts of intrinsic factor the glycoprotein produced in the parietal cells of the stomach lining A functioning small intestine is also necessary for the proper metabolism of the vitamin as absorption occurs within the ileum B12 is produced in the digestive tracts of all animals including humans Thus animalorigin food is the only natural food source of vitamin B12 However synthesis of B12 occurs in the large intestine which is past the point of absorption that occurs within the small intestine As such vitamin B12 must be obtained through diet Deficiencies Unlike other B vitamins which are not stored in the body B12 is stored in the liver Because of this it may take 5‚Äì10 years before a sudden dietary B12 deficiency will become apparent in a previously healthy adult B12 deficiency also known as hypocobalaminemia often results from complications involving absorption into the body B12 deficiency is often associated with pernicious anemia as it is the most common cause Pernicious anemia results from an autoimmune disorder which destroys the cells that produce intrinsic factor within the stomach lining thereby hindering B12 absorption B12 absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron thus people with pernicious anemia often present with typical symptoms of anemia such as pale skin dizziness and fatigue Among those at highest risk for B12 deficiency are the elderly population as 1015 of people aged 60 may present with some form of hypocobalaminemia High rates of deficiency in the elderly commonly results from the decrease of functional absorption of B12 as production of intrinsic factor declines with age However pernicious anemia is the most common cause of B12 deficiency in North American and European populations Those afflicted with various gastrointestinal diseases may also be at risk for deficiency as a result of malabsorption These diseases may affect production of intrinsic factor in the stomach or of pancreatic bile Diseases that involve disorders of the small intestine such as celiac disease Crohns disease and ileitis may also reduce B12 absorption For example people with Celiacs disease may damage the microvilli within their small intestines through the consumption of gluten thereby inhibiting absorption of B12 as well as other nutrients A diet low in B12 whether voluntary or not can also cause symptoms of hypocobalaminemia Many rich sources of B12 come from animal meats and byproductsPopulations in developing countries may not have access to these foods on a consistent basis and as a result may become deficient in B12 In addition vegans and to a lesser extent vegetarians are at risk for consuming a diet low in cobalamin as they voluntarily abstain from animal sources of B12 A combination of these two scenarios may increase prevalence of cobalamin deficit For instance B12 deficiency is problematic in India where the majority of the population is vegetarian and the scarcity of meat consumption is common for omnivores as well Symptoms An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 7590 of individuals of any age with clinically observable B12 deficiency Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord peripheral nerves optic nerves and cerebrum These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of myelin and may be expressed behaviourally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities or motor disturbances such as gait ataxia Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss disorientation and dementia All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes Mental symptoms are extremely variable and include mild disorders of mood mental slowness and memory defect Memory defect encompasses symptoms of confusion severe agitation and depression delusions and paranoid behaviour visual and auditory hallucinations urinary and fecal incontinence in the absence of overt spinal lesions dysphasia violent maniacal behaviour and epilepsy It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism as caused by the state of deficiency All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show symptoms of bleeding gums headache poor concentration shortness of breath and weakness In severe cases of pernicious anemia individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia and memory loss It is not always easy to determine whether B12 deficiency is present especially within older adults Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes They may also present with vague complaints such as fatigue or memory loss that may be attributed to normative aging processes Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimers and other dementias as well Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood Treatment  Patients deficient in B12 despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6\\xa0mg of the vitamin in pill form Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency such as pernicious anemia or old age will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B12 Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patients level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000\\xa0mg of B12 administered intramuscularly daily for one week weekly for one month then monthly for the rest of the patients life Daily oral supplementation of B12 megadoses may be sufficient in reliable patients but it is imperative that the supplementation be continued on a lifelong basis as relapse may occur otherwise The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual As a result early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B12 A deficiency in folate may produce anemia similar to the anemia resulting from B12 deficiency There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B12 deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand In this case patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B12 deficiencyrelated anemia which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency Prevention In addition to meeting intake requirements through food consumption supplementation of diet with vitamin B12 is seen as a viable preventative measure for deficiency It has been recommended for the elderly to supplement 50\\xa0mcg a day in order to prevent deficit from occurring Animal protein products are a good source of B12 particularly organ meats such as kidney or liver Other good sources are fish eggs and dairy products It is suggested that vegans who consume no animal meat or byproducts supplement their diet with B12 While there are foods fortified with B12 available some may be mislabelled in an attempt to boost their nutritional claims Products of fermentation such as algae extracts and sea vegetables may be labelled as sources of B12 but actually contain B12 analogues which compete for the absorption of the nutrient itself In order to get adequate amounts of the vitamin orally administered pills or fortified foods such as cereals and soy milk are recommended for vegans Vitamin D Vitamin D is an essential regulator of the vitamin D receptor that controls gene transcription during development The vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in the substantia nigra Accordingly vitamin D deficiency can disrupt neurogenesis leading to altered dopamine signaling and increased exploratory behavior in rats This is considered a rodent model of the schizophrenia phenotype and vitamin D deficiency has been proposed as an explanation for the increased incidence of schizophrenia among children that were conceived during winter months A Finnish study found that vitamin D supplement use is associated with reduced risk of schizophrenia Lipids Fat Fatty acids are necessary for the synthesis of cell membranes neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules While excessive fat intake can be harmful deficiency of essential fatty acids can disrupt neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity Saturated fat Consuming large amounts of saturated fat can negatively affect your brain Eating foods with saturated fats elevates the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in your body Studies have shown that high levels of triglycerides strongly link with mood problems such as depression hostility and aggression This may occur because high triglyceride levels decrease the amount of oxygen that blood can carry to your brain The American Heart Association recommends that you consume no more than 16g of saturated fat daily Common sources of saturated fat are meat and dairy products Essential fatty acids There are two kinds of essential fatty acids that you must consume omega3 and omega6 Experts say that you need to eat a balanced amount of omega3s and omega6s However some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega6s than omega3s There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression hyperactivity and schizophrenia but it still lacking evidences An omega3 deficient diet increases omega6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depressionlike behaviors in mice Sources of omega3 include flax seeds chia seeds walnuts sea vegetables green leafy vegetables and cold water fish You can find sources of omega6 in walnuts hazelnuts sunflower safflower corn and sesame oils Cholesterol While cholesterol is essential for membranes and steroid hormones excess cholesterol affects blood flow impairing cognitive function in vascular dementia Carbohydrates Studies have shown that learning and memory improve after consuming carbohydrates There are two kinds of carbohydrates that you can consume simple and complex Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods and release sugar into the bloodstream quickly after consumption Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and therefore cause sugar to be released into the bloodstream more slowly Good sources of complex carbohydrates are wholegrain breads pasta brown rice oatmeal and potatoes It is recommended that you consume more complex carbohydrates because consuming complex carbohydrates will cause the level of sugar in your bloodstream to be more stable which will cause less stress hormones to be released Consuming simple carbohydrates may cause the levels of sugar in your bloodstream to rise and fall which can cause mood swings Low carbohydrate ketogenic diets The ketone body betahydroxybutyrate is a fuel source for the brain during times of fasting when blood glucose levels fall Although the mechanism is not understood it is well established that eating a diet low in carbohydrates can be therapeutic for children with epilepsy This is likely a result of ketone bodies providing an alternative fuel source to glucose for neuronal function Furthermore a ketogenic diet can be beneficial for dementia patients Mediumchain triglycerides can stimulate ketone synthesis  and coconut oil is a rich source of medium chain triglycerides that several anecdotal reports suggest can improve cognitive function in Alzheimers type dementia patients Protein When protein is consumed it is broken down into amino acids These amino acids are used to produce many things like neurotransmitters enzymes hormones and chromosomes Proteins known as complete proteins contain all eight of the essential amino acids Meat cheese eggs and yogurt are all examples of complete proteins Incomplete proteins contain only some of the eight essential amino acids and it is recommended that you consume a combination of these proteins Examples of incomplete proteins include nuts seeds legumes and grains When animals are fed a diet deficient in essential amino acids uncharged tRNAs accumulate in the anterior piriform cortex signaling diet rejection 105 The body normally interconverts amino acids to maintain homeostasis but muscle protein can be catabolilzed to release amino acids during conditions of amino acid deficiency Disruption of amino acid metabolism can affect brain development and neurophysiology to affect behavior For example fetal protein deficiency decreases the number of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus Glutamate Glutamate is a proteinogenic amino acid and neurotransmitter though it is perhaps publicly best known in its sodium salt form monosodium glutamate MSG It is also a flavor on its own producing the umami or savory flavor found in many fermented foods such as cheese As an amino acid it acts as a source of fuel for various cellular functions and as a neurotransmitter Glutamate operates as an excitatory neurotransmitter and is released when a nerve impulse excites a glutamate producing cell This in turn binds to neurons with glutamate receptors stimulating them Deficiencies and treatments Glutamate is a nutrient that is extremely difficult to be deficient in as being an amino acid it is found in every food that contains protein Additionally it is found as previously mentioned in fermented foods and in foods containing monosodium glutamate As such good sources of glutamate include meat fish dairy products and a wide array of other foods Glutamate is also absorbed extremely efficiently by the intestines However there are instances of glutamate deficiency occurring but only in cases where genetic disorders are present One such example is Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency and can cause either minor or profound physical and intellectual disabilities depending on the severity of the condition This disorder is extremely rare however as only twenty people have so far been identified with this condition Glutamate while critically important in the body also acts as an excitotoxin in high concentrations not normally found outside of laboratory conditions although it can occur following brain injury or spinal cord injury Phenylalanine LPhenylalanine is biologically converted into Ltyrosine another one of the DNAencoded amino acids and betaphenethylamine Ltyrosine in turn is converted into LDOPA which is further converted into dopamine norepinephrine noradrenaline and epinephrine adrenaline The latter three are known as the catecholamines Phenethylamine is further converted into Nmethylphenethylamine Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and in large quantities interferes with the production of serotonin Phenylketonuria Toxic levels of phenylalanine accumulate in the brains of patients with Phenylketonuria leading to severe brain damage and mental retardation To prevent brain damage these individuals can restrict dietary phenylalanine intake by avoiding protein and supplementing their diet with essential amino acids See also Nutrition and cognition References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutritional rating systems are methods of ranking or rating food products or food categories to communicate the nutritional value of food in a simplified manner to a target audience Rating systems are developed by governments nonprofit organizations or private institutions and companies The methods may use point systems to rank or rate foods for general nutritional value or they may rate specific food attributes such as cholesterol content Graphics or other symbols may be used to communicate the ratings to the target audience Nutritional rating systems differ from nutritional labeling in that they attempt to simplify food choices rather than listing specific amounts of nutrients or ingredients Dietary guidelines are similar to nutritional rating systems in that they attempt to simplify the communication of nutritional information however they do not rate individual food products    Systems in use today Glycemic index Glycemic index is a ranking of how quickly food is metabolized into glucose when digested It compares available carbohydrates gram for gram in individual foods providing a numerical evidencebased index of postprandial postmeal glycemia The concept was invented by Dr David J Jenkins and colleagues in 1981 at the University of Toronto The glycemic load GL of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a persons blood glucose level after eating it Guiding Stars Guiding Stars is patented food rating system that rates food based on nutrient density using a scientific algorithm Foods are credited for vitamins minerals dietary fibre whole grains and Omega3 fatty acids and debited for saturated fats trans fats added sodium salt and added sugar Rated foods are marked with tags indicating one two or three stars The program first launched a Hannaford Supermarkets in 2006 and is currently found in about 1900 supermarkets in the US and Canada Guiding Stars has also expanded into public schools colleges and hospitals The evidencebased proprietary algorithm is based on the dietary guidelines and recommendations of regulatory and health organizations including the US Food and Drug Administration the US Department of Agriculture and the World Health Organization It was developed by a scientific advisory panel composed of experts in nutrition and health from Dartmouth College Harvard University Tufts University University of North Carolina and other colleges Nutripoints Nutripoints is a system for rating foods on a numerical scale for their overall nutritional value The method is based on an analysis of 26 positive such as vitamins minerals protein fiber and negative factors such as cholesterol saturated fat sugar sodium compared to the calories in the food The overall Nutripoint score of the food is the result The higher the value the more nutrition per calorie nutrient density and the least negative factors in the food Thus the higher the Nutripoint score the better the food for overall health The system rates 3600 foods including basic foods like apples and oranges fastfoods and brandname foods Nutripoints was developed by Dr Roy E Vartabedian a Doctor of Public Health in the 1980s and was released to the general public in 1990 with his book Nutripoints published in 13 countries and 10 languages worldwide The food rating system is part of an overall program designed to help people measure balance and upgrade their diets nutritional quality for overall health improvement and wellbeing Nutrition iQ The Nutrition iQ program is a joint venture of the Joslin Clinic and multibanner supermarket operator Supervalu The labeling system consists of colorcoded tags denoting a food products superior status with respect to attributes such as vitamin and mineral content fiber content 100 juice content Omega3 or low saturated fat content whole grain content calcium content protein content low or reduced sodium content and low or reduced caloric content The first phase of the program launched in 2009 covering center store food products with coverage of fresh food departments rolling out in 2011 POINTS Food System Weight Watchers developed the POINTS Food System for use with their Flex Plan Healthy weight control is the primary objective of the system The system is designed to allow customers to eat any food while tracking the number of points for each food consumed Members try to keep to their POINTS Target a number of points for a given time frame The daily POINTS Target is personalized based on members height weight and other factors such as gender A weekly allowance for points is also established to provide for special occasions mistakes etc Naturally Nutrient Rich NNR Developed by Adam Drewnowski University of Washington NNR is based on mean percentage daily values DVs for 14 nutrients in 2000 kcal food can be used to assign nutrient density values to foods within and across food groups Use of the NNR score allows consumers to identify and select nutrientdense foods while permitting some flexibility where the discretionary calories are concerned ReViVer Score Developed by ReViVer a nutritionallyoriented restaurant in New York City the ReViVer Score expresses the nutrient density of menu items from a variety of fast food and casual restaurants based on the amount of 10 nutrients Vitamins A C and E folate calcium magnesium potassium iron fiber and omega3 fats per calorie A score of 100 indicates that the meal provides at least 100 of the recommended daily intake for all ten nutrients proportionate to the energy calorie content of the meal The score allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various restaurant offerings with similar calorie content Systems used in the past Smart Choices Program Launched late in 2009 the Smart Choices Program SCP was a rating system developed by a coalition of companies from the food industry The criteria for rating food products used 18 different attributes however the system had varying levels of acceptability based on 16 types of food which allowed for wide discretion in the selection of foods to include in the program The program was discontinued in October 2009 after sharp criticism for including products such as Froot Loops Lucky Charms and Frosted Flakes as Smart Choices As a consequence of the backlash from the program General Mills announced on December 10 2009 that it would reduce the amount of sugar in many of its cereal brands Announcement of Closure On August 19 2009 the FDA wrote a letter to SCP manager saying FDA and FSIS would be concerned if any FOP labeling systems used criteria that were not stringent enough to protect consumers against misleading claims were inconsistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans or had the effect of encouraging consumers to choose highly processed foods and refined grains instead of fruits vegetables and whole grains SCP was suspended in 2009 after the FDAs announcement that they will be addressing both on frontof package and onshelf systems SCP Chair Mike Hughes said It is more appropriate to postpone active operations and channel our information and learnings to the agency to support their initiative Claimed Rigor Smart Choices Program was developed by a coalition of scientists and nutrition educators experts with experience with dietary guidelines public health organizations and food manufacturers in response to consumer confusion over multiple frontofthepackage systems based on different criteria Representatives from different government organizations acted as observers The process of developing the program was facilitated by the nonprofit Keystone Center an organization that develops consensus solutions to complex health and social policy changes The nutrition criteria for receiving the SCP icon are specific for product category by indicating smarter products within that category A calorie indicator noting calories per serving and servings per package accompanies the SCP icon to remind consumers that calories do count even for smarter food choices For a product to qualify it first has to be below the threshold for nutrients to limit and then in most cases it must be above the threshold for one or more nutrients or food groups to encourage The criteria are based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and other consensus science and are transparent and available on the SCP website See also Main list List of basic nutrition topics  References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Nutritionism is a paradigm that assumes that it is the scientifically identified nutrients in foods that determine the value of individual food stuffs in the diet In other words it is the idea that the nutritional value of a food is the sum of all its individual nutrients vitamins and other components Another aspect of the term is the implication that the only point of eating is to promote bodily health The term is largely pejorative implying that this way of viewing food is simplistic and harmful and the term is usually used to label others views The concepts most prominent opponent and popularizer of the term journalist Michael Pollan argues that a foods nutritional value is more than the sum of its parts Originally credited to Gyorgy Scrinis the notion was popularized by Michael Pollan The key to Pollans understanding of nutritionism is the widely shared but unexamined assumption  that the key to understanding food is indeed the nutrient Since nutrients are invisible it is now necessary to rely on nutrition experts to make food choices Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body Pollan argues relying solely on information regarding individual nutrients has led people and policy makers to repeatedly make poor decisions relating to nutrition Pollan blames nutritionism for many of the health problems relating to diet in the Western World today He compares Nutritionism to a religion relying on priests nutritional scientists and journalists to interpret the latest orthodoxy for the masses Like many religions nutritionism has divided the world into good and evil components although what is good or evil can change dramatically with time Pollan believes that nutritionism is inherently flawed due to a reductive bias within science to isolate and study individual factors disconnected from their usual contexts such as diet and culture factors which have repeatedly been shown to have a fundamental impact on nutritional outcomes Even when scientists have attempted to study factors such as culture diet and long term consumption patterns the enormous difficulties in making accurate measurements relating to individual nutritional components and producing meaningful conclusions has resulted in incomplete results at best and misleading or harmful results at worst Ben Goldacre wrote that nutritionism or its attribution to scientists is the bollocks du jour and that it is driven by a set of first year undergraduate errors in interpreting scientific data In his opinion professional researchers and medical experts bear some blame for nutritionism because they at times created unrealistic expectations about the potential benefits of their research but that the primary promoters of nutritionism are health food manufacturers selfproclaimed gurus and journalists who have an incomplete understanding of science along with a credulous public that is willing to believe whatever simplistic theories they are told in the mass media At least one observer Daniel Engber has argued that Pollans antinutritionism or antifood science stance has taken on a dogmatic tint itself He says Modern nutrition may be more of an ideology than a science but so is Pollans nutritional Darwinism The two ideologies stand in direct opposition to one another with the scienceminded progressives on one side and the culinary conservatives on the other One criticism is that while many scientific studies of nutrition or the conclusions extrapolated from them by both scientists and journalists have been bad we should not reject a scientific approach to food altogether One reviewer notes that the study of vitamins and nutrients led to vast improvement in treatment of diseases such as beriberi or scurvy and that with further refinement food science may well help combat other diseases and health conditions The complexity of food science should not be taken as a reason to abandon systematic investigation of it Daniel Engber also argues that Pollan over idealizes the diet of our ancestors and believes that it may not be well suited to our modern needs See also List of diets References Scrinis Gyorgy 2013 Nutritionism The Science and Politics of Dietary Advice Columbia University Press ISBN\\xa09780231527149 Retrieved 15 April 2015\\xa0 ',\n",

terms dietitian also spelled dietician and nutritionist are not synonymous In many countries and jurisdictions the title nutritionist is not subject to professional regulation thus any person may call themselves a nutritionistnutrition expert even if they are wholly selftaught In the United Kingdom Australia parts of Canada and most US states the term nutritionist is not legally protected whereas the title of dietitian can be used only by those who have met specified professional requirements People who have achieved this standard refer to themselves as Registered Dietitians and use RD after their name One career counselor attempting to describe the difference between the two professions to Canadian students suggested all dietitians are nutritionists but not all nutritionists are dietitians The term nutritionist may be associated with practioners of alternative medicine Prominent examples include Gillian McKeith and Robert O Young There are a sufficiently large number of practicing selfstyled nutritionists without appropriate qualifications to be a distraction to the general public A danger is that many of these unqualified nutritionists can be seen on the World Wide Web to contribute to online health discussions by advising a person to ignore their doctors prescriptions those opinions being the considered opinion of a qualified healthcare professional in favor of some fad foodstuff which they claim will cure all ills Nutritionism practiced in a responsible way by a qualified person could be a robust scientific discipline which uses science to formulate guidelines if it were not for the overwhelming numbers of unqualified practitioners Brazil To obtain the Nutritionist title one must have studied at a recognized university for four years plus a year practice internship The nutritionists are registered at the Conselho Regional de Nutric√£o A Nutritionist can prescribe diets work at hospitals with clinical intervention or in food production segment

when their body mass index BMI a measurement obtained by dividing a persons weight by the square of the persons height is over 30\\xa0kgm2 with the range 25‚Äì30\\xa0kgm2 defined as overweight Some East Asian countries use lower values Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions particularly cardiovascular diseases type 2 diabetes obstructive sleep apnea certain types of cancer osteoarthritis and depression Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake lack of physical activity and genetic susceptibility A few cases are caused primarily by genes endocrine disorders medications or mental disorder The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported On average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energydense foods such as those high in fat and sugars and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber Medications may be used along with a suitable diet to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption If diet exercise and medication are not effective a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide with increasing rates in adults and children In 2015 600 million adults 12 and 100 million children were obese Obesity is more common in women than men Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st\\xa0century Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world particularly in the Western world though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world In 2013 the American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease    Classification    Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health It is defined by body mass index BMI and further evaluated in terms of fat distribution via the waist‚Äìhip ratio and total cardiovascular risk factors BMI is closely related to both percentage body fat and total body fat In children a healthy weight varies with age and sex Obesity in children and adolescents is defined not as an absolute number but in relation to a historical normal group such that obesity is a BMI greater than the 95th\\xa0percentile The reference data on which these percentiles were based date from 1963 to 1994 and thus have not been affected by the recent increases in weight BMI is defined as the subjects weight divided by the square of their height and is calculated as follows                                    B           M           I                                                   m                            h

kilograms per square metre resulting when weight is measured in kilograms and height in metres To convert from pounds per square inch multiply by 703 kgm2lbsq in The most commonly used definitions established by the World Health Organization WHO in 1997 and published in 2000 provide the values listed in the table Some modifications to the WHO definitions have been made by particular organizations The surgical literature breaks down class II and III obesity into further categories whose exact values are still disputed Any BMI ‚â• 35 or 40\\xa0kgm2 is severe obesity A BMI of ‚â• 35\\xa0kgm2 and experiencing obesityrelated health conditions or ‚â•40‚Äì449\\xa0kgm2 is morbid obesity A BMI of ‚â• 45 or 50\\xa0kgm2 is super obesity As Asian populations develop negative health consequences at a lower BMI than Caucasians some nations have redefined obesity Japan have defined obesity as any BMI greater than 25\\xa0kgm2 while China uses a BMI of greater than 28\\xa0kgm2 Effects on health Excessive body weight is associated with various diseases and conditions particularly cardiovascular diseases diabetes mellitus type 2 obstructive sleep apnea certain types of cancer osteoarthritis and asthma As a result obesity has been found to reduce life expectancy Mortality  Obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide A number of reviews have found that mortality risk is lowest at a BMI of 20‚Äì25\\xa0kgm2 in nonsmokers and at 24‚Äì27\\xa0kgm2 in current smokers with risk increasing along with changes in either direction This appears to apply in at least four continents In contrast a 2013 review found that grade 1 obesity BMI 3035 was not associated with higher mortality than normal weight and that overweight BMI 2530 was associated with lower mortality than was normal weight BMI 18525 Other evidence suggests that the association of BMI and waist circumference with mortality is U or Jshaped while the association between waisttohip ratio and waisttoheight ratio with mortality is more positive In Asians the risk of negative health effects begins to increase between 22‚Äì25\\xa0kgm2 A BMI above 32\\xa0kgm2 has been associated with a doubled mortality rate among women over a 16year period In the United States obesity is estimated to cause 111909 to 365000 deaths per year while 1 million 77 of deaths in Europe are attributed to excess weight On average obesity reduces life expectancy by six to seven\\xa0years a BMI of 30‚Äì35\\xa0kgm2 reduces life expectancy by two to four\\xa0years while severe obesity BMI\\xa0gt\\xa040\\xa0kgm2 reduces life expectancy by ten\\xa0years Morbidity  Obesity increases the risk of many physical and mental conditions These comorbidities are most commonly shown in metabolic syndrome a combination of medical disorders which includes diabetes mellitus type 2 high blood pressure high blood cholesterol and high triglyceride levels Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle The strength of the link between obesity and specific conditions varies One of the strongest is the link with type 2 diabetes Excess body fat underlies 64 of cases of diabetes in men and 77 of cases in women Health consequences fall into two broad categories those attributable to the effects of increased fat mass such as osteoarthritis obstructive sleep apnea social stigmatization and those due to the increased number of fat cells diabetes cancer cardiovascular disease nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Increases in body fat alter the bodys response to insulin potentially leading to insulin resistance Increased fat also creates a proinflammatory state and a prothrombotic state Survival paradox  Although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral artery disease PAD In people with heart failure those with a BMI between 300 and 349 had lower mortality than those with a normal weight This has been attributed to the fact that people often lose weight as they become progressively more ill Similar findings have been made in other types of heart disease People with class I obesity and heart disease do not have greater rates of further heart problems than people of normal weight who also have heart disease In people with greater degrees of obesity however the risk of further cardiovascular events is increased Even after cardiac bypass surgery no increase in mortality is seen in the overweight and obese One study found that the improved survival could be explained by the more aggressive treatment obese people receive after a cardiac event Another found that if one takes into account chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD in those with PAD the benefit of obesity no longer exists Causes At an individual level a combination of excessive food energy intake and a lack of physical activity is thought to explain most cases of obesity A limited number of cases are due primarily to genetics medical reasons or psychiatric illness In contrast increasing rates of obesity at a societal level are felt to be due to an easily accessible and palatable diet increased reliance on cars and mechanized manufacturing A 2006 review identified ten other possible contributors to the recent increase of obesity 1 insufficient sleep 2 endocrine disruptors environmental pollutants that interfere with lipid metabolism 3 decreased variability in ambient temperature 4 decreased rates of smoking because smoking suppresses appetite 5 increased use of medications that can cause weight gain eg atypical antipsychotics 6 proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier 7 pregnancy at a later age which may cause susceptibility to obesity in children 8 epigenetic risk factors passed on generationally 9 natural selection for higher BMI and 10 assortative mating leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors this would increase the number of obese people by increasing population variance in weight While there is substantial evidence supporting the influence of these mechanisms on the increased prevalence of obesity the evidence is still inconclusive and the authors state that these are probably less influential than the ones discussed in the previous paragraph Diet    A 2016 review supported excess food as the primary factor Dietary energy supply per capita varies markedly between different regions and countries It has also changed significantly over time From the early 1970s to the late 1990s the average food energy available per person per day the amount of food bought increased in all parts of the world except Eastern Europe The United States had the highest availability with 3654 calories 15290\\xa0kJ per person in 1996 This increased further in 2003 to 3754 calories 15710\\xa0kJ During the late 1990s Europeans had 3394 calories 14200\\xa0kJ per person in the developing areas of Asia there were 2648 calories 11080\\xa0kJ per person and in subSaharan Africa people had 2176 calories 9100\\xa0kJ per person Total food energy consumption has been found to be related to obesity The widespread availability of nutritional guidelines has done little to address the problems of overeating and poor dietary choice From 1971 to 2000 obesity rates in the United States increased from 145 to 309 During the same period an increase occurred in the average amount of food energy consumed For women the average increase was 335 calories 1400\\xa0kJ per day 1542 calories 6450\\xa0kJ in 1971 and 1877 calories 7850\\xa0kJ in 2004 while for men the average increase was 168 calories 700\\xa0kJ per day 2450 calories 10300\\xa0kJ in 1971 and 2618 calories 10950\\xa0kJ in 2004 Most of this extra food energy came from an increase in carbohydrate consumption rather than fat consumption The primary sources of these extra carbohydrates are sweetened beverages which now account for almost 25 percent of daily food energy in young adults in America and potato chips Consumption of sweetened drinks such as soft drinks fruit drinks iced tea and energy and vitamin water drinks is believed to be contributing to the rising rates of obesity and to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes Vitamin D deficiency is related to diseases associated with obesity As societies become increasingly reliant on energydense bigportions and fastfood meals the association between fastfood consumption and obesity becomes more concerning In the United States consumption of fastfood meals tripled and food energy intake from these meals quadrupled between 1977 and 1995 Agricultural policy and techniques in the United States and Europe have led to lower food prices In the United States subsidization of corn soy wheat and rice through the US farm bill has made the main sources of processed food cheap compared to fruits and vegetables Calorie count laws and nutrition facts labels attempt to steer people toward making healthier food choices including awareness of how much food energy is being consumed Obese people consistently underreport their food consumption as compared to people of normal weight This is supported both by tests of people carried out in a calorimeter room and by direct observation Sedentary lifestyle  A sedentary lifestyle plays a significant role in obesity Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work and currently at least 30 of the worlds population gets insufficient exercise This is primarily due to increasing use of mechanized transportation and a greater prevalence of laborsaving technology in the home In children there appear to be declines in levels of physical activity due to less walking and physical education World trends in active leisure time physical activity are less clear The World Health Organization indicates people worldwide are taking up less active recreational pursuits while a study from Finland found an increase and a study from the United States found leisuretime physical activity has not changed significantly A 2011 review of physical activity in children found that it may not be a significant contributor In both children and adults there is an association between television viewing time and the risk of obesity A review found 63 of 73 studies 86 showed an increased rate of childhood obesity with increased media exposure with rates increasing proportionally to time spent watching television Genetics   Like many other medical conditions obesity is the result of an interplay between genetic and environmental factors Polymorphisms in various genes controlling appetite and metabolism predispose to obesity when sufficient food energy is present As of 2006 more than 41 of these sites on the human genome have been linked to the development of obesity when a favorable environment is present People with two copies of the FTO gene fat mass and obesity associated gene have been found on average to weigh 3‚Äì4\\xa0kg more and have a 167fold greater risk of obesity compared with those without the risk allele The differences in BMI between people that are due to genetics varies depending on the population examined from 6 to 85 Obesity is a major feature in several syndromes such as Prader‚ÄìWilli syndrome Bardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome Cohen syndrome and MOMO syndrome The term nonsyndromic obesity is sometimes used to exclude these conditions In people with earlyonset severe obesity defined by an onset before 10\\xa0years of age and body mass index over three standard deviations above normal 7 harbor a single point DNA mutation Studies that have focused on inheritance patterns rather than on specific genes have found that 80 of the offspring of two obese parents were also obese in contrast to less than 10 of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight Different people exposed to the same environment have different risks of obesity due to their underlying genetics The thrifty gene hypothesis postulates that due to dietary scarcity during human evolution people are prone to obesity Their ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more likely to survive famine This tendency to store fat however would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies This theory has received various criticisms and other evolutionarilybased theories such as the drifty gene hypothesis and the thrifty phenotype hypothesis have also been proposed Other illnesses Certain physical and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes listed above as well as some congenital or acquired conditions hypothyroidism Cushings syndrome growth hormone deficiency and the eating disorders binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome However obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder and therefore is not listed in the DSMIVR as a psychiatric illness The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders Certain medications may cause weight gain or changes in body composition these include insulin sulfonylureas thiazolidinediones atypical antipsychotics antidepressants steroids certain anticonvulsants phenytoin and valproate pizotifen and some forms of hormonal contraception Social determinants   While genetic influences are important to understanding obesity they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis the cause of the shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors The correlation between social class and BMI varies globally A review in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes In the developing world women men and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity An update of this review carried out in 2007 found the same relationships but they were weaker The decrease in strength of correlation was felt to be due to the effects of globalization Among developed countries levels of adult obesity and percentage of teenage children who are overweight are correlated with income inequality A similar relationship is seen among US states more adults even in higher social classes are obese in more unequal states Many explanations have been put forth for associations between BMI and social class It is thought that in developed countries the wealthy are able to afford more nutritious food they are under greater social pressure to remain slim and have more opportunities along with greater expectations for physical fitness In undeveloped countries the ability to afford food high energy expenditure with physical labor and cultural values favoring a larger body size are believed to contribute to the observed patterns Attitudes toward body weight held by people in ones life may also play a role in obesity A correlation in BMI changes over time has been found among friends siblings and spouses Stress and perceived low social status appear to increase risk of obesity Smoking has a significant effect on an individuals weight Those who quit smoking gain an average of 44\\xa0kilograms 97\\xa0lb for men and 50\\xa0kilograms 110\\xa0lb for women over ten years However changing rates of smoking have had little effect on the overall rates of obesity In the United States the number of children a person has is related to their risk of obesity A womans risk increases by 7 per child while a mans risk increases by 4 per child This could be partly explained by the fact that having dependent children decreases physical activity in Western parents In the developing world urbanization is playing a role in increasing rate of obesity In China overall rates of obesity are below 5 however in some cities rates of obesity are greater than 20 Malnutrition in early life is believed to play a role in the rising rates of obesity in the developing world Endocrine changes that occur during periods of malnutrition may promote the storage of fat once more food energy becomes available Consistent with cognitive epidemiological data numerous studies confirm that obesity is associated with cognitive deficits Whether obesity causes cognitive deficits or vice versa is unclear at present Gut bacteria  The study of the effect of infectious agents on metabolism is still in its early stages Gut flora has been shown to differ between lean and obese humans There is an indication that gut flora in obese and lean individuals can affect the metabolic potential This apparent alteration of the metabolic potential is believed to confer a greater capacity to harvest energy contributing to obesity Whether these differences are the direct cause or the result of obesity has yet to be determined unequivocally An association between viruses and obesity has been found in humans and several different animal species The amount that these associations may have contributed to the rising rate of obesity is yet to be determined Pathophysiology   There are many possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of obesity This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J M Friedmans laboratory While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system In particular they and other appetiterelated hormones act on the hypothalamus a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus the arcuate nucleus that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus LH and ventromedial hypothalamus VMH the brains feeding and satiety centers respectively The arcuate nucleus contains two distinct groups of neurons The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y NPY and agoutirelated peptide AgRP and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH The second group coexpresses proopiomelanocortin POMC and cocaine and amphetamineregulated transcript CART and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH Consequently NPYAgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety while POMCCART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated in part by leptin Leptin inhibits the NPYAgRP group while stimulating the POMCCART group Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity  Public health The World Health Organization WHO predicts that overweight and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition and infectious diseases as the most significant cause of poor health Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence costs and health effects The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools limiting direct junk food marketing to children and decreasing access to sugarsweetened beverages in schools The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks When constructing urban environments efforts have been made to increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes Reports Many organizations have published reports pertaining to obesity In 1998 the first US Federal guidelines were published titled Clinical Guidelines on the Identification Evaluation and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults The Evidence Report In 2006 the Canadian Obesity Network published the Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines CPG on the Management and Prevention of Obesity in Adults and Children This is a comprehensive evidencebased guideline to address the management and prevention of overweight and obesity in adults and children In 2004 the United Kingdom Royal College of Physicians the Faculty of Public Health and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health released the report Storing up Problems which highlighted the growing problem of obesity in the UK The same year the House of Commons Health Select Committee published its most comprehensive inquiry  ever undertaken into the impact of obesity on health and society in the UK and possible approaches to the problem In 2006 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence NICE issued a guideline on the diagnosis and management of obesity as well as policy implications for nonhealthcare organizations such as local councils A 2007 report produced by Derek Wanless for the Kings Fund warned that unless further action was taken obesity had the capacity to cripple the National Health Service financially Comprehensive approaches are being looked at to address the rising rates of obesity The Obesity Policy Action OPA framework divides measure into upstream policies midstream policies downstream policies Upstream policies look at changing society midstream policies try to alter individuals behavior to prevent obesity and downstream policies try to treat currently afflicted people Management  The main treatment for obesity consists of dieting and physical exercise Diet programs may produce weight loss over the short term but maintaining this weight loss is frequently difficult and often requires making exercise and a lower food energy diet a permanent part of a persons lifestyle In the shortterm low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss In the long term however all types of lowcarbohydrate and lowfat diets appear equally beneficial A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may lower the risk of heart disease Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weightloss Success rates of longterm weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low ranging from 2‚Äì20 Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease Five medications have evidence for longterm use orlistat lorcaserin liraglutide phentermine‚Äìtopiramate and naltrexone‚Äìbupropion They result in weight loss after one year ranged from 30 to 67\\xa0kg over placebo Orlistat liraglutide and naltrexone‚Äìbupropion are available in both the United States and Europe whereas lorcaserin and phentermine‚Äìtopiramate are available only in the United States European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs in part because of associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine‚Äìtopiramate Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys There is no information on how these drugs affect longerterm complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death The most effective treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding RouxenY gastric bypass verticalsleeve gastrectomy and biliopancreatic diversion Surgery for severe obesity is associated with longterm weight loss improvement in obesity related conditions and decreased overall mortality One study found a weight loss of between 14 and 25 depending on the type of procedure performed at 10\\xa0years and a 29 reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures Complications occur in about 17 of cases and reoperation is needed in 7 of cases Due to its cost and risks researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach  Epidemiology   In earlier historical periods obesity was rare and achievable only by a small elite although already recognised as a problem for health But as prosperity increased in the Early Modern period it affected increasingly larger groups of the population In 1997 the WHO formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic As of 2008 the WHO estimates that at least 500\\xa0million adults greater than 10 are obese with higher rates among women than men The percentage of adults affected in the United States as of 20152016 is about 396 overall 379 of males and 411 of females The rate of obesity also increases with age at least up to 50 or 60\\xa0years old and severe obesity in the United States Australia and Canada is increasing faster than the overall rate of obesity Once considered a problem only of highincome countries obesity rates are rising worldwide and affecting both the developed and developing world These increases have been felt most dramatically in urban settings The only remaining region of the world where obesity is not common is subSaharan Africa  History Etymology Obesity is from the Latin obesitas which means stout fat or plump ƒísus is the past participle of edere to eat with ob over added to it The Oxford English Dictionary documents its first usage in 1611 by Randle Cotgrave Historical attitudes   Ancient Greek medicine recognizes obesity as a medical disorder and records that the Ancient Egyptians saw it in the same way Hippocrates wrote that Corpulence is not only a disease itself but the harbinger of others The Indian surgeon Sushruta 6th century BCE related obesity to diabetes and heart disorders He recommended physical work to help cure it and its side effects For most of human history mankind struggled with food scarcity Obesity has thus historically been viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity It was common among high officials in Europe in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance as well as in Ancient East Asian civilizations In the 17th century English medical author Tobias Venner is credited with being one of the first to refer to the term as a societal disease in a published English language book With the onset of the Industrial Revolution it was realized that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range played a significant role in the development of industrialized societies Height and weight thus both increased through the 19th\\xa0century in the developed world During the 20th century as populations reached their genetic potential for height weight began increasing much more than height resulting in obesity In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common During this time period insurance companies realized the connection between weight and life expectancy and increased premiums for the obese Many cultures throughout history have viewed obesity as the result of a character flaw The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of sloth and lust In modern Western culture excess weight is often regarded as unattractive and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes People of all ages can face social stigmatization and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers Public perceptions in Western society regarding healthy body weight differ from those regarding the weight that is considered ideal \\xa0‚Äì and both have changed since the beginning of the 20th century The weight that is viewed as an ideal has become lower since the 1920s This is illustrated by the fact that the average height of Miss America pageant winners increased by 2 from 1922 to 1999 while their average weight decreased by 12 On the other hand peoples views concerning healthy weight have changed in the opposite direction In Britain the weight at which people considered themselves to be overweight was significantly higher in 2007 than in 1999 These changes are believed to be due to increasing rates of adiposity leading to increased acceptance of extra body fat as being normal Obesity is still seen as a sign of wealth and wellbeing in many parts of Africa This has become particularly common since the HIV epidemic began The arts The first sculptural representations of the human body 20000‚Äì35000\\xa0years ago depict obese females Some attribute the Venus figurines to the tendency to emphasize fertility while others feel they represent fatness in the people of the time Corpulence is however absent in both Greek and Roman art probably in keeping with their ideals regarding moderation This continued through much of Christian European history with only those of low socioeconomic status being depicted as obese During the Renaissance some of the upper class began flaunting their large size as can be seen in portraits of Henry VIII of England and Alessandro dal Borro Rubens 1577‚Äì1640 regularly depicted fullbodied women in his pictures from which derives the term Rubenesque These women however still maintained the hourglass shape with its relationship to fertility During the 19th\\xa0century views on obesity changed in the Western world After centuries of obesity being synonymous with wealth and social status slimness began to be seen as the desirable standard Society and culture Economic impact In addition to its health impacts obesity leads to many problems including disadvantages in employment and increased business costs These effects are felt by all levels of society from individuals to corporations to governments In 2005 the medical costs attributable to obesity in the US were an estimated 1902\\xa0billion or 206 of all medical expenditures while the cost of obesity in Canada was estimated at CA2 billion in 1997 24 of total health costs The total annual direct cost of overweight and obesity in Australia in 2005 was A21 billion Overweight and obese Australians also received A356 billion in government subsidies The estimate range for annual expenditures on diet products is 40\\xa0billion to 100\\xa0billion in the US alone Obesity prevention programs have been found to reduce the cost of treating obesityrelated disease However the longer people live the more medical costs they incur Researchers therefore conclude that reducing obesity may improve the publics health but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending  Obesity can lead to social stigmatization and disadvantages in employment When compared to their normal weight counterparts obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40\\xa0kgm2 filed twice as many workers compensation claims as those whose BMI was 185‚Äì249\\xa0kgm2 They also had more than 12\\xa0times as many lost work days The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting thus affecting the lower extremities wrists or hands and backs The Alabama State Employees Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers 25 a month for health insurance that would otherwise be free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35\\xa0kgm2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year Some research shows that obese people are less likely to be hired for a job and are less likely to be promoted Obese people are also paid less than their nonobese counterparts for an equivalent job obese women on average make 6 less and obese men make 3 less Specific industries such as the airline healthcare and food industries have special concerns Due to rising rates of obesity airlines face higher fuel costs and pressures to increase seating width In 2000 the extra weight of obese passengers cost airlines US275\\xa0million The healthcare industry has had to invest in special facilities for handling severely obese patients including special lifting equipment and bariatric ambulances Costs for restaurants are increased by litigation accusing them of causing obesity In 2005 the US Congress discussed legislation to prevent civil lawsuits against the food industry in relation to obesity however it did not become law With the American Medical Associations 2013 classification of obesity as a chronic disease it is thought that health insurance companies will more likely pay for obesity treatment counseling and surgery and the cost of research and development of fat treatment pills or gene therapy treatments should be more affordable if insurers help to subsidize their cost The AMA classification is not legally binding however so health insurers still have the right to reject coverage for a treatment or procedure In 2014 The European Court of Justice ruled that morbid obesity is a disability The Court argued that if an employees obesity prevents him from full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers then it shall be considered a disability and that firing someone on such grounds is discriminatory Size acceptance   The principal goal of the fat acceptance movement is to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and obese However some in the movement are also attempting to challenge the established relationship between obesity and negative health outcomes A number of organizations exist that promote the acceptance of obesity They have increased in prominence in the latter half of the 20th\\xa0century The USbased National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance NAAFA was formed in 1969 and describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to ending size discrimination The International Size Acceptance Association ISAA is a nongovernmental organization NGO which was founded in 1997 It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weightbased discrimination These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act ADA The American legal system however has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this antidiscrimination law to cover obesity Industry influence on research In 2015 the New York Times published an article on the Global Energy Balance Network a nonprofit founded in 2014 that advocated for people to focus on increasing exercise rather than reducing calorie intake to avoid obesity and to be healthy The organization was founded with at least 15M in funding from the CocaCola Company and the company has provided 4M in research funding to the two founding scientists Gregory A Hand and Steven N Blair since 2008 Childhood obesity  The healthy BMI range varies with the age and sex of the child Obesity in children and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95th\\xa0percentile The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st\\xa0century with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11 in the 1980s to over 30 in the 1990s while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14 in Brazilian children As with obesity in adults many factors contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses children who are obese are often tested for hypertension diabetes hyperlipidemia and fatty liver Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success In the United States medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group Multicomponent behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low Other animals  Obesity in pets is common in many countries In the United States 23‚Äì41 of dogs are overweight and about 51 are obese The rate of obesity in cats was slightly higher at 64 In Australia the rate of obesity among dogs in a veterinary setting has been found to be 76 The risk of obesity in dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese however there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners Notes  References

       "  'raw page text': 'Obesogens are foreign chemical compounds that disrupt normal development and balance of lipid metabolism which in some cases can lead to obesity Obesogens may be functionally defined as chemicals that inappropriately alter lipid homeostasis and fat storage change metabolic setpoints disrupt energy balance or modify the regulation of appetite and satiety to promote fat accumulation and obesity There are many different proposed mechanisms through which obesogens can interfere with the bodys adipose tissue biology These mechanisms include alterations in the action of metabolic sensors dysregulation of sex steroid synthesis action or breakdown changes in the central integration of energy balance including the regulation of appetite and satiety and reprogramming of metabolic setpoints Some of these proposed pathways include inappropriate modulation of nuclear receptor function which therefore allows the compounds to be classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals that act to mimic hormones in the body altering the normal homeostasis maintained by the endocrine system Obesogens have been detected in the body both as a result of intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of pharmaceutical drugs such as diethylstilbestrol selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and thiazolidinedione and as a result of unintentional exposure to environmental obesogens such as tributyltin bisphenol A diethylhexylphthalate and perfluorooctanoate Emerging evidence from laboratories around the world suggests that other chemicals will be confirmed as falling under this proposed classification in the near future and that there may be some serious biological effects due to exposure to these chemicals that still remain undiscovered Until now 20 chemicals have been found responsible for inducing obesity within an individual The term obesogen was coined in 2006 by Felix Gr√ºn and Bruce Blumberg of the University of California Irvine The topic of this proposed class of chemical compounds and how to counteract their effects is explored at length in the book The New American Diet Paula BaillieHamilton a naturopath in the UK hypothesized that obesogens make it difficult to lose weight in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2002    Mechanisms of action There are many ways in which obesogenic drugs and chemicals can disrupt the bodys adipose tissue biology The three main mechanisms of action include alterations in the action of metabolic sensors in which obesogens mimic metabolic ligands acting to either block or upregulate hormone receptors dysregulation of sex steroid synthesis in which they alter the ratio of sex hormones leading to changes in their control of lipid balance changes in the central integration of energy balance including the regulation of appetite and satiety in the brain and the reprogramming of metabolic setpoints Metabolic sensors Obesogenic drugs and chemicals have been shown to target transcription regulators found in gene networks that function to control intracellular lipid homeostasis and proliferation and differentiation on adipocytes The major group of regulators that is targeted is a group of nuclear hormone receptors known as peroxisome proliferator activated receptors PPARŒ± Œ¥ and Œ≥ These hormone receptors sense a variety of metabolic ligands including lipophilic hormones dietary fatty acids and their metabolites and depending on the varying levels of these ligands control transcription of genes involved in balancing the changes in lipid balance in the body To become active and properly function as metabolic sensors and transcription regulators the PPAR receptors must heterodimerize with another receptor known as the 9cis retinoic acid receptor RXR The RXR receptor itself is the second major target of obesogens next to the PPAR receptors The PPARŒ± receptor when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of a lipid promotes peroxisome proliferation leading to increased fatty acid Œ≤oxidation Substances such a xenobiotics that target and act as agonists of PPARŒ± typically act to reduce overall serum concentrations of lipids In contrast the PPARŒ≥ receptor when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of fatty acids or their derivatives promotes lipid biosynthesis and storage of lipids is favored over fatty acid oxidation In addition activation promotes differentiation of preadipocytes and the conversion of mesenchymal progenitor cells to preadipocytes in adipose tissues Substances that target and act as agonists of PPARŒ≥RXR complex typically act to increase overall serum concentrations of lipids Obesogens that target the PPARŒ≥RXR complex mimic the metabolic ligands and activate the receptor leading to upregulation of lipid accumulation which explains their obesogenic effects However in the case of obesogens that target the PPARŒ±RXR complex which when stimulated reduces adipose mass and body weight there are a few explanations as to how they promote obesity The ligand binding pockets of PPARs are very large and unspecified allowing for different isoforms of the receptor PPARŒ± Œ¥ and Œ≥ to be activated by the same agonist ligands or their metabolites In addition fatty acid oxidation stimulated by PPARŒ± requires continuous stimulation while only a single activation event of PPARŒ≥ is required to permanently increase adipocyte differentiation and number Therefore it may be the case that metabolites of PPARŒ± targeting obesogens are also activating PPARŒ≥ providing the single activation event needed to potentially lead to a proadipogenic response A second explanation points to specific PPARŒ± targeters that have been shown to additionally cause abnormal transcriptional regulation of testicular steroidogenesis when introduced during fetal development This abnormal regulation leads to a decreased level of androgen in the body which itself is obesogenic Finally if PPARŒ± activation occurs during critical periods of development the resulting decrease in lipid concentration in the developing fetus is recognized by the fetal brain as undernourishment In this case the developing brain makes what will become permanent changes to the bodys metabolic control leading to longterm upregulation of lipid storage and maintenance Sex steroid dysregulation Sex steroids normally play a significant role in lipid balance in the body Aided by other peptide hormones such as growth hormone they act against the lipid accumulation mediated by insulin and cortisol by mobilizing lipid stores that are present Exposure to obesogens often leads to a deficiency or change in the ratio between androgen and estrogen sex steroid levels which modifies this method of lipid balance resulting in lowered growth hormone secretion hypocortisolemia low levels of circulating cortisol and increased resistance to insulin effects This alteration in sex steroid levels due to obesogens can vary enormously according to both the sex of the exposed individual as well as the timing of the exposure If the chemicals are introduced at critical windows of development the vulnerability of an individual to their effects is much higher than if exposure occurs later in adulthood It has been shown that obesogenic effects are apparent in female mice exposed to both phytoestrogens and DES during their neonatal periods of development as they though born with a lower birth weight almost always developed obesity high leptin levels and altered glucose response pathways Both phytoestrogen and DES exposed male mice did not develop obesity and rather showed decreased body weights with increased exposure confirming the role of gender differences in exposure response Further studies have shown positive correlations for serum BPA levels with obese females in the human population along with other xenoestrogen compounds suggesting the parallel roles that these effects may be having on humans Central balance of energy While hormone receptors tend to be the most obvious candidates for targets of obesogens central mechanisms that balance and regulate the bodys nutritional changes on a daytoday basis as a whole cannot be overlooked The HPA axis hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal is involved in controlling appetite and energy homeostasis circuits which are mediated by a large number of monoaminoergic peptidergic use of hormones as neurotransmitters and endocannabinoid signals that come from the digestive tract adipose tissues and from within the brain It is these types of signals that provide a likely target for obesogens that have shown to have weight altering effects Neuroendocrine effects Neurological disorders may enhance the susceptibility to develop the metabolic syndrome that includes obesity Many neuropharmaceuticals used to alter behavioral pathways in patients with neurological disorders have shown to have metabolic altering sideeffects leading to obesogenic phenotypes as well These findings give evidence to conclude that an increase in lipid accumulation can result from the targeting of neurotransmitter receptors by foreign chemicals See also section Central integration of energy balance Peptidergic hormones Several peptidergic hormone pathways controlling appetite and energy balance ‚Äîsuch as those involving ghrelin neuropeptide Y and agoutirelated peptide ‚Äî are particularly sensitive to changes in nuclear receptor signaling pathways and can therefore be easily altered by the introduction of endocrine disruptors Such an alteration can lead to induced feelings of hunger and decreased feelings of fullness causing an increase in food intake and inability to feel satisfied both characteristic of obesity Some xenoestrogens such as BPA nonylphenol and DEHP have all shown to act is this way altering NPY expression and significantly shifting the feeding behaviors of exposed mice In addition organotins such as trimethyltin TMT triethyltin TET and tributyltin TBT compounds can exert their effects through similar pathways TBT can locally disrupt aromatase regulation in the hypothalamus causing the responses of the HPA axis to hormones to become abnormal TMT works in a similar but unique way inducing NPY and NPY2 receptor expression initially which later is counteracted by neuronal degeneration in lesions causing decrease in signaling ability While an increase in food intake is often the case after exposure weight gain involves the bodys maintenance of its metabolic setpoint as well Given this information it is particularly important to note that exposure during development and initial programming of these setpoints can be extremely significant throughout the remainder of life Endocannabinoid signaling A wide range of environmental organotins that mimic petidergic hormones in the HPA axis as mentioned before additionally mimic lipid activators of the cannabinoid system and inhibit AMPK activity Endocannaboid levels are high in those suffering from obesity due to hyperactivity of cannaboid signalling pathways It is these high levels that have been found to be closely associated with increased fat stores linking the lipid activator mimics to the actual disease Programming of metabolic set points Regions in the hypothalamus control the responses that establish an individuals metabolic setpoint and metabolic efficiency These responses are adaptive in that they vary according to the individuals needs always working to restore the metabolic setpoint through the increase or decrease of metabolic functions depending on varying energy needs Since it is adapted it is expected that it would be able to achieve equilibrium if the lipid balance was altered by hormones via the mechanisms mentioned above However since obesogenic phenotypes persist it can be concluded that adaptive response components of the hypothalamus may be a target of obesogens as well A persons body composition is very much predetermined before birth and changes rarely occur in adulthood Adipocyte numbers increase during development and come to a plateau over time After the plateau adipocytes become restricted to mostly hypertrophic growth and dont seem to change much in terms of cell number This is demonstrated by the difficulty in altering somatotypes or more simply by the difficulty that goes along with trying to lose weight past a certain point A particular study on PBDEs a commonly used chemical in flame retardants made its role in altering the functions of the thyroid hormone axis apparent This finding leads to increased concern as neonatal thyroid status plays a large role in the integration of maternal environmental signals during development in the womb that is used for longterm body weight programming Pharmaceutical obesogens Obesogens detection in the body and resulting obesogenic effects can result as side effects from intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of pharmaceutical drugs These pharmaceutical obesogens can show their effects through a variety of targets Metabolic sensors Thiazolidinediones TZD rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are all used to treat diabetes These drugs act as agonists of the PPARŒ≥ receptor leading to insulin sensitizing effects that can improve glycemic control and serum triglyceride levels Despite the positive effects these chemicals can have in treating diabetes patients administration also lead to unwanted PPARŒ≥ mediated side effects such as peripheral edema which can be followed by persistent weight gain if the drug is used over a long period of time These side effects are particularly prominent in diabetes 2 patients a disease that tends to result from an overabundance of adipose tissue Sex steroid dysregulation DES is a synthetic estrogen that was once prescribed to women to decrease the risk of miscarriage until it was found to be causing abnormalities in exposed offspring This same chemical has been shown to cause weight gain in female mice when exposed during neonatal development While exposure didnt lead to an abnormal birth weight significant weight gain occurred much later in adulthood Central integration of energy balance SSRI eg paroxetine tricyclic antidepressants eg amitriptyline tetracyclic antidepressants eg mirtazapine and atypical antipsychotics eg clozapine are all neuropharmaceuticals that target neurotransmitter receptors that are involved with brain circuits that regulate behavior Often the function of these receptors overlaps with metabolism regulation such as that of the H1 receptor which when activated decreases AMPK activity As a result the administration of these drugs can have side effects including increased lipid accumulation that can result in obesity Metabolic setpoints The mechanisms behind SSRI tricyclic antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics function allow them all to have potential roles in the alteration of metabolic setpoints TZD in particular has been linked to regulatory function in the HPT axis however no conclusive evidence has been determined thus far and further research is required to confirm these hypotheses Environmental obesogens While obesogens can be introduced to the body intentionally via administration of obesogenic pharmaceuticals exposure can also occur through chemical exposure to obesogens found in the environment such as organotins and xenobiotics Organotins Particular members of the organotin class of persistent organic pollutants POPs namely tributyltin TBT and triphenyltin TPT are highly selective and act as very potent agonists of both the retinoid X receptors RXR Œ±Œ≤ and Œ≥ and PPARŒ≥ This ability to target both receptors at the same time is more effective than single receptor activation as adopogenic signaling can be mediated through both components of the heterodimer complex This highly effective activation mechanism can pose detrimental longterm adipogenic effects especially if exposure occurs during development and early life Organotins tinbased chemicals used in marine antifouling paints wood catalysts plasticizers slimicides in industrial water systems and fungicides on food have recently been linked to obesogenic properties when introduced in the body Human exposure to these major environmental sources most commonly occurs through ingestion of contaminated seafood agricultural products and drinking water as well as from exposure to leaching from plastics Although studies that have directly measured organotin levels in human tissue and blood are limited it has been determined that vulnerability of a portion of the general population to organotin exposure at levels high enough to activate RXRs and PPARŒ≥ receptors is very probable The high usage of organotins in both plastics and agricultural maintenance as well as the high affinity of the chemicals further confirms this conclusion Liver samples from the late 1990s in Europe and Asia contained on average 6 and 84\\xa0ngg wet wt respectively for total organotin levels while later studies found levels of total organotins in US blood samples averaged around 21\\xa0ngmL with TBT comprising around 8\\xa0ngmL  27 nM Even more recent analyses of European blood samples found the predominant species to be TPT rather than TBT at 009 and 067\\xa0ngmL 052 nM Only occasional trace amounts of TBT were found These results indicate that organtin exposure to humans while found to be present among many different populations can vary in terms of type of organatin and level of exposure from region to region Other xenobiotics Other common xenobiotics found in the environment have been shown to have PPAR activity posing even further threats to dysregulated metabolic balance BPA from polycarbonate plastics phthalate plasticizers used to soften PVC plastics and various perfluoroalkyll compounds PFCs that are widely used surfactants and surface repellents in consumer products are all potentially obesogenic when introduced in the body Phthalates and PFCs in particular have been found to function as agonists for one or more of the PPARs  Additionally metabolites of DHEP such as MEHP also activate PPARŒ≥ leading to a proadipogenic response Public health implications Although research on endocrine disruptors or obesogens is still emerging the public health implications so far have mainly surrounded obesity diabetes and cardiovascular disease Obesity has become a global epidemic increasing for all population groups From 1980 to 2008 the rates of obesity have doubled for adults and tripled for children In the US alone it has been estimated that almost 100 million individuals in are obese Traditional thinking suggested that diet and exercise alone were the main contributors to obesity however current experimental evidence shows that obesogens might be part of the cause The chronic burden of obesity doesnt stop with weight gain It can also lead to potentially debilitating chronic diseases such as diabetes and certain environmental exposures or obesogens have been directly linked to Type II diabetes mellitus T2DM An estimated 258 million people or 83 of the population in the US have diabetes and the crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased by 176 from 1980 through 2010 The disease and economic burden of diabetes which is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States costing approximately 174 billion annually is being addressed by organizations such as Healthy People 2020 which has diabetes listed as one of their 42 objectives However diabetes is a major obstacle to overcome especially when obesogens might be the uncontrolled unsuspected cause Potential obesogens in everyday life Obesogens can be found everywhere from water bottles to microwaveable popcorn and from nonstick pans to shower curtains People interact with them on a daily basis both intentionally and unintentionally at work school and home They are an unnecessary and mostly preventable potential hazard to health which can have a large impact on how individuals gain and lose weight BisphenolA BPA is an industrial chemical and organic compound that has been used in the production of plastics and resins for over a halfcentury It is used in products such as toys medical devices plastic food and beverage containers shower curtains dental sealants and compounds and register receipts BPA has been shown to seep into food sources from containers or into the body just by handling products made from it Certain researchers suggest that BPA actually decreases the fat cell count in the body but at the same time increasing the size of the ones remaining therefore no difference in weight is shown and an individual is even likely to gain more Highfructose corn syrup HFCS is found in many food products on grocery store shelves by 2004 for example it accounted for 40 of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages sold in the United States and was the only caloric sweetener used in soft drinks It is used as a food and drink sweetener and is an obesogen Acting on insulin and leptin in the body HFCS potentially increases appetite and fat production Nicotine is the chemical found in tobacco products and certain insecticides As an obesogen nicotine mostly acts on prenatal development after maternal smoking occurs A strong association has been made between maternal smoking and childhood overweightobesity with nicotine as the single causal agent Arsenic is a metalloid ie an element with some metallic properties found in and on most naturally occurring substances on Earth It can be found in the soil ground water air and in small concentrations in food Arsenic has many applications such as in the production of insecticides herbicides pesticides and electronic devices The development of diabetes has been linked to arsenic exposure from drinking water and occupational contact Pesticides are substances used to prevent destroy repel or mitigate pests and they have been used throughout all of recorded history Some pesticides persist for short periods of time and some for long periods of time which are considered persistent organic pollutants POPs Several crosssectional studies have shown pesticides as obesogens linking them to obesity diabetes and other morbidities Pharmaceutical drugs are also potentially obesogens From 20052008 11 of Americans aged 12 and over took antidepressant medications Certain antidepressants known as selectively serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs are potentially adding to the almost 100 million obese individuals in the US A key function of SSRI antidepressants is to regulate serotonin reuptake transporter SERT which can affect food intake and lipid accumulation leading to obesity Organotins such as tributyltin TBT and triphenyltin TPT are endocrine disruptors that have been shown to increase triglyceride storage in adipocytes Although they have been widely used in the marine industry since the 1960s other common sources of human exposure include contaminated seafood and shellfish fungicides on crops and as antifungal agents used in wood treatments industrial water systems and textiles Organotins are also being used in the manufacture of PVC plastics and have been identified in drinking water and food supplies Perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA is a surfactant used for reduction of friction and it is also used in nonstick cookware PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98 of the general US population It is a potential endocrine disruptor Animal studies have shown that prenatal exposure to PFOA is linked to obesity when reaching adulthood Future Research Most of the environmental obesogens currently identified are either classified into the category of chemical mimics of metabolic hormones throughout the body or of neurotransmitters within the brain Because they fall into these two categories extensive opportunities for complex interactions and varied sites of action as well as multiple molecular targets are open for consideration Changing dose ranges tend to result in varying phenotypes and timing of exposure gender and gender predisposition introduce even more levels of complexity in how these substances effect the human body Because the mechanisms behind the different effects of obesogens are so complex and not well understood the extent to which they play in the current obesity epidemic may be greater than once thought Epigenetic changes due to obesogen exposure must also be considered as a possibility as they open up the potential for misregulated metabolic functions to be passed on from generation to generation Epigenetic processes via hypermethylation of regulatory regions could lead to overexpression of different proteins and therefore amplification of acquired environmental effects Research will be required in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action these chemicals are involved in before the extent of the risk of exposure can be determined and methods of prevention and removal from the environment can be established See also Adiposopathy Bariatrics Obesity Childhood obesity Orexigenic Epidemiology of obesity Epidemiology of childhood obesity References  Further reading  External links Newsweek

       "  'raw page text': 'An oligosaccharide from the Greek ·ΩÄŒªŒØŒ≥ŒøœÇ ol√≠gos a few and œÉŒ¨Œ∫œáŒ±œÅ s√°cchar sugar is a saccharide polymer containing a small number typically three to ten of monosaccharides simple sugars Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding For example glycolipids have an important role in the immune response They are normally present as glycans oligosaccharide chains linked to lipids or to compatible amino acid side chains in proteins by N or Oglygosidic bonds Nlinked oligosaccharides are always pentasaccharides attached to asparagine via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain Alternately Olinked oligosaccharides are generally attached to threonine or serine on the alcohol group of the side chain Not all natural oligosaccharides occur as components of glycoproteins or glycolipids Some such as the raffinose series occur as storage or transport carbohydrates in plants Others such as maltodextrins or cellodextrins result from the microbial breakdown of larger polysaccharides such as starch or cellulose    Glycosylation In biology glycosylation is the process by which a carbohydrate is covalently attached to an organic molecule creating structures such as glycoproteins and glycolipids Nlinked Oligosaccharides  Nlinked glycosylation involves oligosaccharide attachment to asparagine via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain The process of Nlinked glycosylation occurs cotranslationally or concurrently while the proteins is being translated Since it is added cotranslationally it is believed that Nlinked glycosylation helps determine the folding of polypeptides due to the hydrophilic nature of sugars All Nlinked Oligosaccharides are pentasaccharides five monosaccharides long In Nglycosylation for eukaryotes the oligosaccharide substrate is assembled right at the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum For prokaryotes this process occurs at the plasma membrane In both cases the acceptor substrate is an asparagine residue The asparagine residue linked to an Nlinked oligosaccharide usually occurs in the sequence AsnXSerThr where X can be any amino acid except for proline although it is rare to see Asp Glu Leu or Trp in this position Olinked Oligosaccharides  Oligosaccharides that participate in Olinked glycosylation are attached to threonine or serine on the hydroxyl group of the side chain Olinked glycosylation occurs in the golgi apparatus where monosaccharide units are added to a complete polypeptide chain Cell surface proteins and extracellular proteins are Oglycosylated Glycosylation sites in Olinked oligosaccharides are determined by the secondary and tertiary structures of the polypeptide which dictate where glycosyltransferases will add sugars Glycosylated biomolecules Glycoproteins and glycolipids are by definition covalently bonded to carbohydrates They are very abundant on the surface of the cell and their interactions contribute to the overall stability of the cell Glycoproteins Glycoproteins have distinct Oligosaccharide structures which have significant effects on many of their properties affecting critical functions such as antigenicity solubility and resistance to proteases Glycoproteins are relevant as cellsurface receptors celladhesion molecules immunoglobulins and tumor antigens Glycolipids Glycolipids are important for cell recognition and are important for modulating the function of membrane proteins that act as receptors Glycolipids are lipid molecules bound to oligosaccharides generally present in the lipid bilayer Additionally they can serve as receptors for cellular recognition and cell signaling The head of the oligosaccharide serves as a binding partner in receptor activity The binding mechanisms of receptors to the oligosaccharides depends on the composition of the oligosaccharides that are exposed or presented above the surface of the membrane There is great diversity in the binding mechanisms of glycolipids which is what makes them such an important target for pathogens as a site for interaction and entrance For example the chaperone activity of glycolipids has been studied for its relevance to HIV infection Functions Cell Recognition All cells are coated in either glycoproteins or glycolipids both of which help determine cell types Lectins or proteins that bind carbohydrates can recognize specific oligosaccharides and provide useful information for cell recognition based on oligosaccharide binding An important example of oligosaccharide cell recognition is the role of glycolipids in determining blood types The various blood types are distinguished by the glycan modification present on the surface of blood cells These can be visualized using mass spectrometry The oligosaccharides found on the A B and H antigen occur on the nonreducing ends of the oligosaccharide The H antigen which indicates an O blood type serves as a precursor for the A and B antigen Therefore a person with A blood type will have the A antigen and H antigen present on the glycolipids of the red blood cell plasma membrane A person with B blood type will have the B and H antigen present A person with AB blood type will have A B and H antigens present And finally a person with O blood type will only have the H antigen present This means all blood types have the H antigen which explains why the O blood type is known as the universal donor Cell Adhesion Many cells produce specific carbohydratebinding proteins known as lectins which mediate cell adhesion with oligosaccharides Selectins  a family of lectins  mediate certain cellcell adhesion processes including those of leukocytes to endothelial cells In an immune response endothelial cells can express certain selectins transiently in response to damage or injury to the cells In response a reciprocal selectinoligosaccharide interaction will occur between the two molecules which allows the white blood cell to help eliminate the infection or damage ProteinCarbohydrate bonding is often mediated by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces Role in mothertochild transmission of HIV1 Mixed feeding of breast milk and formula or other nonhuman milk increases the risk of postnatal transmission of HIV1 Most exclusively breastfed infants do not contract the virus from the infected mother The specific glycans that are present in human breast milk can inhibit HIV1 transfer by competing with the HIV1 surface glycoprotein gp120 for binding to dendritic ICAM3grabbing nonintegrin DCSIGN Human milk contains many complex oligosaccharides that carry multiple Lewis antigen glycans These human milk oligosaccharides reduce gp120 binding by more than 80 thereby inhibiting HIV1 mothertochild transmission Dietary oligosaccharides Fructooligosaccharides FOS which are found in many vegetables are short chains of fructose molecules They differ from inulin which has a much higher degree of polymerization than FOS and is therefore a polysaccharide but like inulin they are considered soluble dietary fibre Galactooligosaccharides GOS which also occur naturally consist of short chains of galactose molecules These compounds cannot be digested in the human small intestine and instead pass through to the large intestine where they promote the growth of Bifidobacteria which are beneficial to gut health Mannan oligosaccharides MOS are widely used in animal feed to improve gastrointestinal health They are normally obtained from the yeast cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mannan oligosaccharides differ from other oligosaccharides in that they are not fermentable and their primary mode of actions include agglutination of type1 fimbria pathogens and immunomodulation Sources Oligosaccharides are a component of fibre from plant tissue FOS and inulin are present in Jerusalem artichoke burdock chicory leeks onions and asparagus Inulin is a significant part of the daily diet of most of the world‚Äôs population FOS can also be synthesized by enzymes of the fungus Aspergillus niger acting on sucrose GOS is naturally found in soybeans and can be synthesized from

       "  'raw page text': 'Oxygen radical absorbance capacity ORAC is a method of measuring antioxidant capacities in biological samples in vitro A wide variety of foods have been tested using this method with certain spices berries and legumes rated highly in extensive tables once published by the United States Department of Agriculture USDA but withdrawn in 2012 since no correlation between test results and biological activity could be determined stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed in support of the freeradical theory Although not all have been unilaterally dismissive the majority position supports the USDA decision Alternative measurements include the FolinCiocalteu reagent and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay    Method The assay measures the oxidative degradation of the fluorescent molecule either betaphycoerythrin or fluorescein after being mixed with free radical generators such as azoinitiator compounds Azoinitiators are considered to produce the peroxyl radical by heating which damages the fluorescent molecule resulting in the loss of fluorescence Antioxidants are considered to protect the fluorescent molecule from the oxidative degeneration The degree of protection is quantified using a fluorometer Fluorescein is currently used most as a fluorescent probe Equipment that can automatically measure and calculate the capacity is commercially available Biotek Roche Diagnostics The fluorescent intensity decreases as the oxidative degeneration proceeds and this intensity is typically recorded for 35 minutes after the addition of the azoinitiator free radical generator So far AAPH 22‚Äôazobis2amidinopropane dihydrochloride is the sole freeradical generator used The degeneration or decomposition of fluorescein is measured as the presence of the antioxidant slows the fluorescence decay Decay curves fluorescence intensity vs time are recorded and the area between the two decay curves with or without antioxidant is calculated Subsequently the degree of antioxidantmediated protection is quantified using the antioxidant trolox a vitamin E analogue as a standard Different concentrations of trolox are used to make a standard curve and test samples are compared to this Results for test samples foods have been published as trolox equivalents or TEs One benefit of using the ORAC method to evaluate substances antioxidant capacities is that it takes into account samples with and without lag phases of their antioxidant capacities This is especially beneficial when measuring foods and supplements that contain complex ingredients with various slow and fastacting antioxidants as well as ingredients with combined effects that cannot be precalculated Drawbacks of this method are 1 only antioxidant activity against particular probably mainly peroxyl radicals is measured however peroxyl radical formation has never been proven 2 the nature of the damaging reaction is not characterized 3 there is no evidence that free radicals are involved in this reaction and 4 there is no evidence that ORAC values have any biological significance following consumption of any food Moreover the relationship between ORAC values and a health benefit has not been established Resulting from scientific refutation of the physiological significance of ORAC the USDA which had been collating and publishing ORAC data for more than a decade withdrew its web publication of ORAC values for common American foods in May 2012 Several modified ORAC methods have been proposed Most of them employ the same principle ie measurement of AAPHradical mediated damage of fluorescein however ORACEPR electron paramagnetic resonancebased ORAC method directly measures the decrease of AAPHradical level by the scavenging action of the antioxidant substance Regulatory guidance In the following discussion the term antioxidant refers mainly to nonnutrient compounds in foods such as polyphenols which have antioxidant capacity in vitro so provide an artificial index of antioxidant strength‚Äîthe ORAC measurement Other than for dietary antioxidant vitamins‚Äîvitamin A vitamin C and vitamin E‚Äîno food compounds have been proved with antioxidant efficacy in vivo Accordingly regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration of the United States and the European Food Safety Authority EFSA have published guidance forbidding food product labels to claim or imply an antioxidant benefit when no such physiological evidence exists This guidance for the United States and European Union establishes it is illegal to imply potential health benefits on package labels of products with high ORAC Physiological context Although research in vitro indicates polyphenols are good antioxidants and probably influence the ORAC value antioxidant effects in vivo are probably negligible or absent By nonantioxidant mechanisms still undefined flavonoids and other polyphenols may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer As interpreted by the Linus Pauling Institute EFSA and the USDA dietary polyphenols have little or no direct antioxidant food value following digestion Not like controlled test tube conditions the fate of polyphenols in vivo shows they are poorly conserved less than 5 with most of what is absorbed existing as chemically modified metabolites destined for rapid excretion The increase in antioxidant capacity of blood seen after the consumption of polyphenolrich ORACrich foods is not caused directly by the polyphenols but most likely results from increased uric acid levels derived from metabolism of flavonoids According to Frei we can now follow the activity of flavonoids in the body and one thing that is clear is that the body sees them as foreign compounds and is trying to get rid of them Food sources Values are expressed as the sum of the lipid soluble eg carotenoid and watersoluble eg phenolic antioxidant fractions ie ‚Äútotal ORAC‚Äù reported as in micromoles trolox equivalents TE per 100\\xa0gram sample and are compared to assessments of total polyphenol content in the samples These values are considered biologically irrelevant by the EFSA and USDA With nearly all vegetables conventional boiling can reduce the ORAC value by up to 90 while steaming retains more of the antioxidants Comparisons of ORAC values The United States Department of Agriculture previously a publisher of ORAC data withdrew its web publication of ORAC values for common American foods in 2012 due to absence of scientific evidence that ORAC has any biological significance When comparing ORAC data care must be taken to ensure the units and food being compared are similar Some evaluations will compare ORAC units per gram of dry weight of the intact food or its milled powder others will evaluate ORAC units in fresh or frozen wet weight and still others will look at ORAC units per serving Under each evaluation different foods can appear to have higher ORAC values For example although a raisin has no more antioxidant potential than the grape from which it was dried raisins will appear to have a higher ORAC value per gram of wet weight than grapes due to their reduced water content Likewise the large water content in watermelon can make it appear as though this fruit is low in ORAC Similarly the typical quantity of food used should be considered herbs and spices may be high in ORAC but are applied in much smaller quantities compared to intact whole foods Numerous health food and beverage companies and marketers have erroneously capitalized on the ORAC rating by promoting products claimed to be high in ORAC As most of these ORAC values have not been independently validated or subjected to peer review for publication in scientific literature they remain unconfirmed are not scientifically credible and may mislead consumers See also List of antioxidants in food Polyphenol antioxidants Reduction potential Trolox TEAC References  External links Xu

       "  'raw page text': 'Parasitic nutrition is a mode of heterotrophic nutrition where a parasitic organism lives on the body surface or inside the body of another type of organism a host and gets nutrition directly from the body of the host Since these parasites derive nourishment from their host this symbiotic interaction is often described as harmful to the host Parasites depend on their host for survival since the host provides nutrition and protection As a result of this dependence parasites have considerable modifications to optimise parasitic nutrition and therefore their survival Parasites are divided into two groups endoparasites and ectoparasites Endoparasites are parasites that live inside the body of the host whereas ectoparasites are parasites that live on the outer surface of the host and generally attach themselves during feeding Due to the different strategies of endoparasites and ectoparasites they require different adaptations to derive nutrients from their host Parasites require nutrients to carry out essential functions including reproduction and growth Essentially the nutrients required from the host are carbohydrates amino acids and lipids Carbohydrates are utilised to generate energy whilst amino acids and fatty acids are involved in the synthesis of macromolecules and the production of eggs Most parasites are heterotrophs so they therefore are unable to synthesise their own food ie organic compounds and must acquire these from their host    Endoparasitism Endoparasites live inside the body of the host This group includes helminths trematodes and cestodes Endoparasites are two groups of parasites intercellular and intracellular parasites Intercellular parasites live in spaces within the host eg the alimentary canal whereas intracellular parasites live in cells within the host eg erythrocytes Intracellular parasites typically rely on a third organism a vector to transmit the parasite between hosts Rather than requiring adaptations to penetrate the host as ectoparasites do endoparasites are in a nutrientrich location so they instead have adaptations to maximise nutrient absorption Endoparasites have a readily available and renewable supply of nutrients inside the host which in some cases is predigested by the host so mechanisms of nutrient absorption across their body surface is a common feature As part of their life cycle strategy endoparasites must also be able to transmit from within the host body and survive the hostile environment within the host Only by achieving this can they benefit from acquiring nutrition in this way  Endoparasites have various anatomical and biochemical adaptations typically at the hostparasite interface to maximise nutrient acquisition One such adaptation is the tegument a metabolically active external cover that plays an important role in nutrient extraction from the host The parasite tegument is permeable to various organic solutes and has transporters for the facilitated or active uptake of nutrients Various studies have attempted to characterise these transporters in a number of parasites eg the amino acid transporter molecules in protozoa Cestodes do not have a gut so the tegument is therefore critical for nutrient uptake In cestodes the tegument is highly efficient with spinelike microtriches similar to microvilli to increase the surface area available for nutrient acquisition In many parasites the tegument structure has folds or microvilli to maximise the surface area available for diffusion and uptake of nutrients The tegument also commonly has additional organelles and features with important functions in metabolism including the glycocalyx The glycocalyx is a carbohydraterich layer that enhances nutrient absorption and secretes enzymes to aid primary digestion Another important adaptation of endoparasites is the gut which digests host macromolecules into soluble utilisable products This feature is particularly important for endoparasites that are not in the alimentary canal because nutrients are not predigested by the host The gut lining typically has a layer of endodermal cells that secrete proteolytic enzymes to aid digestion Some endoparasites have both a gut and anus some lack an anus and some have neither‚Äîie those that live in the alimentary canal which instead diffuse predigested host nutrients across their body surface The relative importance of the tegument gut and other adaptations involved in nutrient acquisition varies between different endoparasitic species Tapeworms  Tapeworms are endoparasites with numerous adaptations to enhance parasitic nutrition Tapeworms live in the small intestine of humans providing an ideal location to access a readily available rich source of predigested nutrients Since nutrients in the small intestine are plentiful and predigested by the host tapeworms do not require a gut and instead have adaptations to maximise nutrient absorption Tapeworms have a tegument that they use to absorb nutrients directly from the host small intestine by diffusion They also have anatomical adaptations in the form of a scolex with hookers and suckers that they use to attach to the host small intestine wall preventing the tapeworm from being egested following peristalsis Tapeworms have a flattened body with microtriches to maximise the surface area available for nutrient absorption and they additionally have various transporter molecules Tapeworms have to compete with the host epithelium for nutrients so it is essential that they compete more efficiently for nutrients They also secrete enzymes to enhance host digestive enzymes eg pancreatic Œ±amylase Schistosomes Schistosomes another type of endoparasite also live inside the body of the host but instead these parasites acquire their nutrients from host blood Schistosomes are in direct contact with host blood a rich source of amino acids and they therefore do not require penetrative structures to reach host nutrients Schistosomes take blood up through the negative pressure created by muscle contractions of their sucker and oesophagus They obtain amino acids from host blood through a mechanism of haemoglobin degradation which remains unresolved but is suggested to involve a series of proteases Mechanisms to overcome blood clotting are also employed Various studies have attempted to characterise the components of the schistosome tegument including transporter molecules that may be involved in nutrient uptake Such transporter molecules include schistosome alkaline phosphatase SmAP and cathepsin B which may be important in nutrient acquisition Malaria Malaria caused by the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum is an intracellular endoparasite This parasite relies on a third organism in the form of an Anopheles mosquito vector The host blood provides an ideal rich source of glucose and amino acids to the parasite particularly during blood stage infection where Plasmodium infects erythrocytes To acquire essential nutrients Plasmodium has to compete with both the vertebrate and insect host and therefore must be highly efficient regulating uptake according to nutrient availability Plasmodium along with many other endoparasitic parasites have numerous channels in their parasitophorous vacuole membrane rendering it permeable to organic solutes to allow the uptake of necessary nutrients The Plasmodium falciparum hexose transporter PfHT is such a transporter which is critical for the uptake of glucose and fructose and therefore survival of the parasite These organic molecules have to cross three membranes altogether the plasma membrane of the erythrocyte the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the Plasmodium plasma membrane facilitated by transporters such as PfHT Ectoparasitism Ectoparasites live on the outer surface of the host This group includes ticks leeches mites and the tsetse fly Ectoparasites do not have a readily available source of nutrients available on the outer surface of the host so they need adaptations to access host nutrients This requires penetrating features they can insert into the host as well as the ability to secrete digestive enzymes and the presence of a gut to digest hostderived nutrients Ectoparasites also have a variety of parasite transporters and permeases to enable them to acquire nutrition from their host across numerous membranes Many ectoparasites are known pathogen vectors so they transmit these pathogens during nutrient acquisition Tsetse flies the insect vector of Trypanosoma brucei the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis are an example of an ectoparasite These insects have a specialised structure a proboscis that they use to pierce and draw nutrients from their host These then employ transport proteins to transport the essential nutrients across membranes ultimately from the host to the tsetse fly gut for digestion Various permeases have been characterised including those that import hexoses carboxylates and amino acids Another ectoparasite is scabies caused by Sarcoptes scabiei Scabies transmitted by female mites depends on nutrition from its host for survival This ectoparasite obtains nutrients by burrowing into the skin of the host Studies have also identified the presence of scabies mite inactivated protease paralogues SMIPPs which are believed to compete with host proteases Effects on the host Parasitic nutrition is beneficial to the parasite but typically detrimental to the host since it deprives the host of nutrients This mode of nutrition has numerous side effects on the host including weight loss anaemia obstruction of the intestine damage to the host intestinal wall and in some cases transmission of serious pathogens‚Äîeg the ectoparasitic tsetse fly which transmits African trypanosomiasis Applications Nutrient acquisition is an important component of parasite pathogenesis since it is critical to parasite survival Understanding the mechanisms of parasite nutrient acquisition therefore identifies novel targets we can exploit as a form of parasite control‚Äîeg through knockout or inhibition of crucial transporters or destruction of penetrative anatomical features Several studies have looked into nutrient acquisition as a method of parasite control including the development of vaccines against helminth parasites by targeting digestive proteases Parasitic nutrition in plants Plants are typically autotrophic organisms meaning that they synthesise their own food from inorganic compounds by photosynthesis Some plants however are unable to synthesise their own food by photosynthesis and therefore acquire nutrients by parasitic nutrition from other living plants Plants that acquire nutrients in this way are called parasitic plants These plants have modified root structures called haustorium that they use to penetrate the vascular bundle of host plants and essentially steal nutrients from host plants Parasitic plants include Dodder Rafflesia and Broomrape See also Holozoic nutrition Saprophytic nutrition References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Total Parenteral nutrition PN is the feeding of a person intravenously bypassing the usual process of eating and digestion The person receives nutritional formulae that contain nutrients such as glucose salts amino acids lipids and added vitamins and dietary minerals It is called total parenteral nutrition TPN or total nutrient admixture TNA when no significant nutrition is obtained by other routes and partial parenteral nutrition PPN when nutrition is also partially enteric It may be called peripheral parenteral nutrition PPN when administered through vein access in a limb rather than through a central vein as central venous nutrition CVN    Medical uses Total parenteral nutrition TPN is provided when the gastrointestinal tract is nonfunctional because of an interruption in its continuity it is blocked or has a leak  a fistula or because its absorptive capacity is impaired It has been used for comatose patients although enteral feeding is usually preferable and less prone to complications Parenteral nutrition is used to prevent malnutrition in patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrients by oral or enteral routes Gastrointestinal disorders TPN may be the only feasible option for providing nutrition to patients who do not have a functioning gastrointestinal tract or who have disorders requiring complete bowel rest including bowel obstruction short bowel syndrome Gastroschisis prolonged diarrhea regardless of its cause highoutput fistula very severe Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis and certain pediatric GI disorders including congenital GI anomalies and necrotizing enterocolitis In cancer The benefit of TPN to cancer patients is largely debated and studies to date have generally showed minimal long term benefit On the other hand there is no evidence to support the idea that intravenous nutrition feeds the cancer not the patient Duration Shortterm PN may be used if a persons digestive system has shut down for instance by peritonitis and they are at a low enough weight to cause concerns about nutrition during an extended hospital stay Longterm PN is occasionally used to treat people suffering the extended consequences of an accident surgery or digestive disorder PN has extended the life of children born with nonexistent or severely deformed organs Living with TPN Approximately 40000 people use TPN at home in the United States and because TPN requires anywhere from 10‚Äì16 hours to be administered daily life can be affected Although daily lifestyle can be changed most patients agree that these changes are better than staying at the hospital Many different types of pumps exist to limit the time the patient is ‚Äúhookedup‚Äù Usually a backpack pump is used allowing for mobility The time required to be connected to the IV is dependent on the situation of each patient some require once a day or five days a week It is important for patients to avoid as much TPN related change as possible in their lifestyles This allows for the best possible mental health situation constantly being held down can lead to resentment and depression Physical activity is also highly encouraged but patients must avoid contact sports equipment damage and swimming infection Many teens find it difficult to live with TPN due to issues regarding body image and not being able to participate in activities and events Complications TPN fully bypasses the GI tract and normal methods of nutrient absorption Possible complications which may be significant are listed below Infection TPN requires a chronic IV access for the solution to run through and the most common complication is infection of this catheter Infection is a common cause of death in these patients with a mortality rate of approximately 15 per infection and death usually results from septic shock Blood clots Chronic IV access leaves a foreign body in the vascular system and blood clots on this IV line are common Death can result from pulmonary embolism wherein a clot that starts on the IV line but breaks off goes into the lungs  Patients on TPN who have such clots occluding their catheter may receive a thrombolytic flush to dissolve the clots and prevent further complications Fatty liver and liver failure Fatty liver is usually a more long term complication of TPN though over a long enough course it is fairly common The pathogenesis is due to using linoleic acid an omega6 fatty acid component of soybean oil as a major source of calories TPNassociated liver disease strikes up to 50 of patients within 5‚Äì7 years correlated with a mortality rate of 2‚Äì50 Onset of this liver disease is the major complication that leads TPN patients to requiring an intestinal transplant Hunger Because patients are being fed intravenously the subject does not physically eat resulting in intense hunger pangs The brain uses signals from the mouth taste and smell the stomachGI Tract fullness and blood nutrient levels to determine conscious feelings of hunger In cases of TPN the taste smell and physical fullness requirements are not met and so the patient experiences hunger despite the fact that the body is being fully nourished Patients who eat food despite the inability can experience a wide range of complications Cholecystitis Total parenteral nutrition increases the risk of acute cholecystitis due to complete disuse of gastrointestinal tract which may result in bile stasis in the gallbladder Other potential hepatobiliary dysfunctions include steatosis steatohepatitis cholestasis and cholelithiasis Six percent of patients on TPN longer than 3 weeks and 100 of patients on TPN longer than 13 weeks develop biliary sludge The formation of sludge is the result of stasis due to lack of enteric stimulation and is not due to changes in bile composition Gallbladder sludge disappears after 4 weeks of normal oral diet Administration of exogenous cholecystokinin CCK or stimulation of endogenous CCK by periodic pulse of large amounts of amino acids have been shown to help prevent sludge formation These therapies are not routinely recommended Such complications are suggested to be the main reason for mortality in people requiring longterm total parenteral nutrition such as in short bowel syndrome In newborn infants with short bowel syndrome with less than 10 of expected intestinal length thereby being dependent upon total parenteral nutrition 5 year survival is approximately 20 Gut atrophy Infants who are sustained on TPN without food by mouth for prolonged periods are at risk for developing gut atrophy Other complications Other complications are either related to catheter insertion or metabolic including refeeding syndrome Catheter complications include pneumothorax accidental arterial puncture and catheterrelated sepsis The complication rate at the time of insertion should be less than 5 Catheterrelated infections may be minimised by appropriate choice of catheter and insertion technique Metabolic complications include the refeeding syndrome characterised by hypokalemia hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia Hyperglycemia is common at the start of therapy but can be treated with insulin added to the TPN solution Hypoglycaemia is likely to occur with abrupt cessation of TPN Liver dysfunction can be limited to a reversible cholestatic jaundice and to fatty infiltration demonstrated by elevated transaminases Severe hepatic dysfunction is a rare complication Overall patients receiving TPN have a higher rate of infectious complications This can be related to hyperglycemia Pregnancy Pregnancy can cause major complications when trying to properly dose the nutrient mixture Because all of the baby‚Äôs nourishment comes from the mother‚Äôs blood stream the doctor must properly calculate the dosage of nutrients to meet both recipient‚Äôs needs and have them in usable forms Incorrect dosage can lead to many adverse hardtoguess effects such as death and varying degrees of deformation or other developmental problems It is recommended that parenteral nutrition administration begin after a period of natural nutrition so doctors can properly calculate the nutritional needs of the fetus Otherwise it should only be administered by a team of highly skilled doctors who can accurately assess the fetus‚Äô needs Total parenteral nutrition  Solutions for total parenteral nutrition may be customized to individual patient requirements or standardized solutions may be used The use of standardized parenteral nutrition solutions is cost effective and may provide better control of serum electrolytes Ideally each patient is assessed individually before commencing on parenteral nutrition and a team consisting of specialised doctors nurses clinical pharmacists and Registered Dietitians evaluate the patients individual data and decide what PN formula to use and at what infusion rate For energy only intravenous sugar solutions with dextrose or glucose are generally used This is not considered to be parenteral nutrition as it does not prevent malnutrition when used on its own Standardized solutions may also differ between developers Following are some examples of what compositions they may have The solution for normal patients may be given both centrally and peripherally Components Prepared solutions Prepared solutions generally consist of water and electrolytes glucose amino acids and lipids essential vitamins minerals and trace elements are added or given separately Previously lipid emulsions were given separately but it is becoming more common for a threeinone solution of glucose proteins and lipids to be administered Added components Individual nutrient components may be added to more precisely adjust the body contents of it That individual nutrient may if possible be infused individually or it may be injected into a bag of nutrient solution or intravenous fluids volume expander solution that is given to the patient Administration of individual components may be more hazardous than administration of premixed solutions such as those used in total parenteral nutrition because the latter are generally already balanced in regard to eg osmolarity and ability to infuse peripherally Incorrect IV administration of concentrated potassium can be lethal but this is not a danger if the potassium is mixed in TPN solution and diluted Vitamins may be added to a bulk premixed nutrient immediately before administration since the additional vitamins can promote spoilage of stored product Vitamins can be added in two doses one fatsoluble the other watersoluble There are also singledose preparations with both fat and watersoluble vitamins such as Cernevit Minerals and trace elements for parenteral nutrition are available in prepared mixtures such as Addaven Emulsifier Only a limited number of emulsifiers are commonly regarded as safe to use for parenteral administration of which the most important is lecithin Lecithin can be biodegraded and metabolized since it is an integral part of biological membranes making it virtually nontoxic Other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys creating a toxic load The emulsifier of choice for most fat emulsions used for parenteral nutrition is a highly purified egg lecithin due to its low toxicity and complete integration with cell membranes Use of eggderived emulsifiers is not recommended for people with an egg allergy due to the risk of reaction In situations where there is no suitable emulsifying agent for a person at risk of developing essential fatty acid deficiency cooking oils may be spread upon large portions of available skin for supplementation by transdermal absorption Another type of fat emulsion Omegaven is being used experimentally within the US primarily in the pediatric population It is made of fish oil instead of the egg based formulas more widely in use Research has shown use of Omegaven may reverse and prevent liver disease and cholestasis History Developed in the 1960s by Dr Stanley J Dudrick who as a surgical resident in the University of Pennsylvania working in the basic science laboratory of Dr Jonathan Rhoads was the first to successfully nourish initially Beagle puppies and subsequently newborn babies with catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancies Dr Dudrick collaborated with Dr Willmore

       "  'raw page text': 'Phosphatidylserine abbreviated PtdLSer or PS is a phospholipid and is a component of the cell membrane It plays a key role in cell cycle signaling specifically in relationship to apoptosis    Structure Phosphatidylserine is a phospholipid more specifically a glycerophospholipid It consists of two fatty acids attached in ester linkage to the first and second carbon of glycerol and serine attached through a phosphodiester linkage to the third carbon of the glycerol Phosphatidylserine coming from plants and phosphatidylserine coming from animals differ in fatty acid composition Biological function Cell signaling Phosphatidylserines are actively held facing the cytosolic inner side of the cell membrane by the enzyme flippase However when a cell undergoes apoptosis phosphatidylserine is no longer restricted to the cytosolic side by flippase Instead scramblase catalyzes the rapid exchange of phosphatidylserine between the two sides When the phosphatidylserines flip to the extracellular outer surface of the cell they act as a signal for macrophages to engulf the cells Coagulation Phosphatidylserine plays a role in blood coagulation also known as clotting When circulating platelets encounter the site of an injury collagen and thrombin mediated activation causes externalization of phosphatidylserine PS from the inner membrane layer where it serves as a procoagulant surface This surface acts to orient coagulation proteases specifically tissue factor TF and factor VII the tenase complex facilitating further proteolysis activation of factor X and ultimately generating thrombin In the coagulation disorder Scott syndrome the mechanism in platelets for transportation of PS from the inner platelet membrane surface to the outer membrane surface is defective It is characterized as a mild bleeding disorder stemming from the patients deficiency in thrombin synthesis Biosynthesis  Phosphatidylserine is biosynthesized in bacteria by condensing the amino acid serine with CDP cytidine diphosphateactivated phosphatidic acid In mammals phosphatidylserine is produced by baseexchange reactions with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine Conversely phosphatidylserine can also give rise to phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine although in animals the pathway to generate phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylserine only operates in the liver Dietary sources The average daily phosphatidylserine PS intake from diet in Western countries is estimated to be 130\\xa0mg PS may be found in meat and fish Only small amounts of PS can be found in dairy products or in vegetables with the exception of white beans and soy lecithin Table 1 PS content in different foods Soy products are not in this table because commercial PS is made by enzymatically converting soy phosphatidylcholine lecithin to phosphatidylserine rather than purifying phosphatidylserine from soy Supplementation Health claims A panel of the European Food Safety Authority concluded that a cause and effect relationship cannot be established between the consumption of phosphatidylserine and memory and cognitive functioning in the elderly‚Äù ‚Äúmental healthcognitive function‚Äù and ‚Äústress reduction and enhanced memory function‚Äù The reason is that bovine brain cortex and soybased phosphatidylserine are different substances and might therefore have different biological activities Therefore the results of studies using PS coming from different sources cannot be generalized Cognition In May 2003 the Food and Drug Administration gave qualified health claim status to phosphatidylserine thus allowing labels to state consumption of phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly along with the disclaimer very limited and preliminary scientific research suggests that phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly FDA concludes that there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim The FDA declared that based on its evaluation of the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence the agency concludes that there is not significant scientific agreement among qualified experts that a relationship exists between phosphatidylserine and reduced risk of dementia or cognitive dysfunction The FDA also noted Of the 10 intervention studies that formed the basis of FDAs evaluation all were seriously flawed or limited in their reliability in one or more ways concluding that most of the evidence does not support a relationship between phosphatidylserine and reduced risk of dementia or cognitive dysfunction and that the evidence that does support such a relationship is very limited and preliminary Early studies of phosphatidylserine on memory and cognition used a supplement which isolated the molecule from the bovine brain Currently most commercially available products are made from cabbage or soybeans because of concerns about mad cow disease in bovine brain tissue These plantbased products have a similar but not identical chemical structure to the bovine derived supplements for example the FDA notes the phosphatidylserine molecule from soy lecithin contains mainly polyunsaturated acids while the phosphatidylserine molecule from bovine brain cortex contains mainly saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids A preliminary study in rats in 1999 indicated that the soy derived phosphatidylserine supplement was as effective as the bovine derived supplement in one of three behavioral tests However clinical trials in humans prior to 2010 found that a daily supplement of SPS soybeanderived phosphatidylserine does not affect memory or other cognitive functions in older individuals with memory complaints Then in 2010 a Japanese randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trial examining a sample of 78 subjects with mild cognitive impairment after a longer 6month period found improvement in the group with the lowest memory test scores when soybased PS was administered orally concluding that supplementation could be useful for preventing dementia in people with memory complaints Safety Traditionally PS supplements were derived from bovine cortex BCPS However due to the risk of potential transfer of infectious diseases soyderived PS SPS supplements have been used as an alternative Soyderived PS is designated Generally Recognized As Safe by the FDA A 2002 safety report determined supplementation in elder

       "  'raw page text': 'Phytic acid known as inositol hexakisphosphate IP6 inositol polyphosphate or phytate when in salt form discovered in 1903 a saturated cyclic acid is the principal storage form of phosphorus in many plant tissues especially bran and seeds It can be found in cereals and grains Catabolites of phytic acid are called lower inositol polyphosphates Examples are inositol penta IP5 tetra IP4 and triphosphate IP3    Significance in agriculture Phosphorus and inositol in phytate form are not in general bioavailable to nonruminant animals because these animals lack the digestive enzyme phytase required to remove phosphate from the inositol in the phytate molecule Ruminants are readily able to digest phytate because of the phytase produced by rumen microorganisms In most commercial agriculture nonruminant livestock such as swine fowl and fish are fed mainly grains such as maize legumes and soybeans Because phytate from these grains and beans is unavailable for absorption the unabsorbed phytate passes through the gastrointestinal tract elevating the amount of phosphorus in the manure Excess phosphorus excretion can lead to environmental problems such as eutrophication Also viable lowphytic acid mutant lines have been developed in several crop species in which the seeds have drastically reduced levels of phytic acid and concomitant increases in inorganic phosphorus However germination problems have reportedly hindered the use of these cultivars thus far This may be due to phytic acids critical role in both phosphorus and metal ion storage The use of sprouted grains will reduce the quantity of phytic acids in feed with no significant reduction of nutritional value Phytate variants also have the potential to be used in soil remediation to immobilize uranium nickel and other inorganic contaminants Biological and physiological roles Although indigestible for many animals phytic acid and its metabolites as they occur in seeds and grains have several important roles for the seedling plant Most notably phytic acid functions as a phosphorus store as an energy store as a source of cations and as a source of myoinositol a cell wall precursor Phytic acid is the principal storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds In animal cells myoinositol polyphosphates are ubiquitous and phytic acid myoinositol hexakisphosphate is the most abundant with its concentration ranging from 10 to 100 ¬µM in mammalian cells depending on cell type and developmental stage This compound is not obtained from the animal diet but must be synthesized inside the cell from phosphate and inositol which in turn is produced from glucose usually in the kidneys The interaction of intracellular phytic acid with specific intracellular proteins has been investigated in vitro and these interactions have been found to result in the inhibition or potentiation of the physiological activities of those proteins The best evidence from these studies suggests an intracellular role for phytic acid as a cofactor in DNA repair by nonhomologous endjoining Other studies using yeast mutants have also suggested intracellular phytic acid may be involved in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytosol There are still major gaps in the understanding of this molecule and the exact pathways of phytic acid and lower inositol phosphate metabolism are still unknown As such the exact physiological roles of intracellular phytic acid are still a matter of debate Food science Phytic acid mostly as phytate is found within the hulls of seeds including nuts grains and pulses Inhome food preparation techniques can break down the phytic acid in all of these foods Simply cooking the food will reduce the phytic acid to some degree More effective methods are soaking in an acid medium sprouting and lactic acid fermentation such as in sourdough and pickling No detectable phytate less than 002\\xa0 of wet weight was observed in vegetables such as scallion and cabbage leaves or in fruits such as apples oranges bananas or pears Phytic acid has a strong binding affinity to important minerals such as calcium iron and zinc although the binding of calcium with phytic acid is pHdependent The binding of phytic acid with iron is more complex although there certainly is a strong binding affinity molecules like phenols and tannins also influence the binding When iron and zinc bind to phytic acid they form insoluble precipitates and are far less absorbable in the intestines This process can therefore contribute to iron and zinc deficiencies in people whose diets rely on these foods for their mineral intake such as those in developing countries and vegetarians As a food additive phytic acid is used as the preservative E391 Chestnuts contain 47 mg of phytic acid for 100g Oak acorn of Quercus ilex contains 127 mg of phytic acid for 100g Medical uses Studies examining the effects of phytic acid demonstrate that they are important in regulating vital cellular functions Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated striking anticancer preventive as well as therapeutic effects of phytic acid Research shows anticarcinogenic effects albeit to a lesser extent and it acts in inhibiting cancer In addition to reduction in cell proliferation phytic acid increases differentiation of malignant cells often resulting in reversion to the normal phenotype The study concludes that Given the numerous health benefits phytates participation in important intracellular biochemical pathways normal physiological presence in our cells tissues plasma urine etc the levels of which fluctuate with intake epidemiological correlates of phytate deficiency with disease and reversal of those conditions by adequate intake and safety ‚Äì all strongly

       "  'raw page text': 'Phytochemicals are chemical compounds produced by plants generally to help them thrive or thwart competitors predators or pathogens The name comes from the Greek word phyton meaning plant Some phytochemicals have been used as poisons and others as traditional medicine As a term phytochemicals is generally used to describe plant compounds that are under research with unestablished effects on health and are not scientifically defined as essential nutrients Regulatory agencies governing food labeling in Europe and the United States have provided guidance for industry limiting or preventing health claims about phytochemicals on food product or nutrition labels    Definition Plants are composed entirely of chemicals of various kinds Phytochemicals from Greek phyto meaning plant are chemicals produced by plants through primary or secondary metabolism They generally have biological activity in the plant host and play a role in plant growth or defense against competitors pathogens or predators Phytochemicals generally are regarded as research compounds rather than essential nutrients because proof of their possible health effects has not been established yet Phytochemicals under research can be classified into major categories such as carotenoids and polyphenols which include phenolic acids flavonoids and stilbeneslignans Flavonoids can be further divided into groups based on their similar chemical structure such as anthocyanins flavones flavanones and isoflavones and flavanols Flavanols further are classified as catechins epicatechins and proanthocyanidins Phytochemists study phytochemicals by first extracting and isolating compounds from the origin plant followed by defining their structure or testing in laboratory model systems such as cell cultures in vitro experiments or in vivo studies using laboratory animals Challenges in that field include isolating specific compounds and determining their structures which are often complex and identifying what specific phytochemical is primarily responsible for any given biological activity History of uses  Without specific knowledge of their cellular actions or mechanisms phytochemicals have been used as poison and in traditional medicine For example salicin having antiinflammatory and painrelieving properties was originally extracted from the bark of the white willow tree and later synthetically produced to become the common overthecounter drug aspirin The tropane alkaloids of A belladonna were used as poisons and early humans made poisonous arrows from the plant In Ancient Rome it was used as a poison by Agrippina the Younger wife of Emperor Claudius on advice of Locusta a lady specialized in poisons and Livia who is rumored to have used it to kill her husband Emperor Augustus The English yew tree was long known to be extremely and immediately toxic to animals that grazed on its leaves or children who ate its berries however in 1971 paclitaxel was isolated from it subsequently becoming an important cancer drug As of 2017 the biological activities for most phytochemicals are unknown or poorly understood in isolation or as part of foods Phytochemicals with established roles in the body are classified as essential nutrients Functions The phytochemical category includes compounds recognized as essential nutrients which are naturally contained in plants and are required for normal physiological functions so must be obtained from the diet in humans Some phytochemicals are known phytotoxins that are toxic to humans for example aristolochic acid is carcinogenic at low doses Some phytochemicals are antinutrients that interfere with the absorption of nutrients Others such as some polyphenols and flavonoids may be prooxidants in high ingested amounts Nondigestible dietary fibers from plant foods often considered as a phytochemical are now generally regarded as a nutrient group having approved health claims for reducing the risk of some types of cancer and coronary heart disease Eating a diet high in fruits vegetables grains legumes and plantbased beverages has longterm health benefits but there is no evidence that taking dietary supplements of nonnutrient phytochemicals extracted from plants similarly benefits health Phytochemical supplements are neither recommended by health authorities for improving health nor approved by regulatory agencies for health claims on product labels Consumer and industry guidance While health authorities encourage consumers to eat diets rich in fruit vegetables whole grains legumes and nuts to improve and maintain health evidence that such effects result from specific nonnutrient phytochemicals is limited or absent For example systematic reviews andor metaanalyses indicate weak or no evidence for phytochemicals from plant food consumption having an effect on breast lung or bladder cancers Further in the United States regulations exist to limit the language on product labels for how plant food consumption may affect cancers excluding mention of any phytochemical except for those with established health benefits against cancer such as dietary fiber vitamin A and vitamin C Phytochemicals such as polyphenols have been specifically discouraged from food labeling in Europe and the United States because there is no evidence for a causeandeffect relationship between dietary polyphenols and inhibition or prevention of any disease Among carotenoids such as the tomato phytochemical lycopene the US Food and Drug Administration found insufficient evidence for its effects on any of several cancer types resulting in limited language for how products containing lycopene can be described on labels Effects of food processing Phytochemicals in freshly harvested plant foods may be degraded by processing techniques including cooking The main cause of phytochemical loss from cooking is thermal decomposition A converse exists in the case of carotenoids such as lycopene present in tomatoes which may remain stable or increase in content from cooking due to liberation from cellular membranes in the cooked food Food processing techniques like mechanical processing can also free carotenoids and other phytochemicals from the food matrix increasing dietary intake In some cases processing of food is necessary to remove phytotoxins or antinutrients for example societies that use cassava as a staple have traditional practices that involve some processing soaking cooking fermentation etc which are necessary to avoid getting sick from cyanogenic

       "  'raw page text': 'Phytoestrogens are plantderived xenoestrogens see estrogen not generated within the endocrine system but consumed by eating phytoestrogenic plants Also called dietary estrogens they are a diverse group of naturally occurring nonsteroidal plant compounds that because of their structural similarity with estradiol 17Œ≤estradiol have the ability to cause estrogenic orand antiestrogenic effects by sitting in and blocking receptor sites against estrogen  Their name comes from the Greek phyto plant and estrogen the hormone which gives fertility to female mammals The word estrus  Greek ŒøŒØœÉœÑœÅŒøœÇ  means sexual desire and gene  Greek Œ≥œåŒΩŒø  is to generate It has been hypothesized that plants use phytoestrogens as part of their natural defence against the overpopulation of herbivore animals by controlling female fertility The similarities at molecular level of estrogens and phytoestrogens allow them to mildly mimic and sometimes act as antagonists of estrogen Phytoestrogens were first observed in 1926 but it was unknown if they could have any effect in human or animal metabolism In the 1940s and early 1950s it was noticed that some pastures of subterranean clover and red clover phytoestrogenrich plants had adverse effects on the fecundity of grazing sheep Researchers are exploring the nutritional role of phytoestrogens in the regulation of cholesterol and the maintenance of proper bone density postmenopause Evidence is accruing that phytoestrogens may have protective action against diverse health disorders such as prostate breast bowel and other cancers cardiovascular disease brain function disorders and osteoporosis Phytoestrogens cannot be considered nutrients given that the lack of these in the diet does not produce any characteristic deficiency syndrome nor do they participate in any essential biological function Analytical methods are available to determine phytoestrogen content in plants and food    Structure Phytoestrogens mainly belong to a large group of substituted natural phenolic compounds the coumestans prenylflavonoids and isoflavones are three of the most active in estrogenic effects in this class The bestresearched are isoflavones which are commonly found in soy and red clover Lignans have also been identified as phytoestrogens although they are not flavonoids Mycoestrogens have similar structures and effects but are not components of plants these are mold metabolites of Fusarium especially common on cereal grains but also occurring elsewhere eg on various forages Although mycoestrogens are rarely taken into account in discussions about phytoestrogens these are the compounds that initially generated the interest on the topic Mechanism of action Phytoestrogens exert their effects primarily through binding to estrogen receptors ER There are two variants of the estrogen receptor alpha ERŒ± and beta ERŒ≤ and many phytoestrogens display somewhat higher affinity for ERŒ≤ compared to ERŒ± The key structural elements that enable phytoestrogens to bind with high affinity to estrogen receptors and display estradiollike effects are The phenolic ring that is indispensable for binding to estrogen receptor The ring of isoflavones mimicking a ring of estrogens at the receptors binding site Low molecular weight similar to estrogens MW272 Distance between two hydroxyl groups at the isoflavones nucleus similar to that occurring in estradiol Optimal hydroxylation pattern In addition to interaction with ERs phytoestrogens may also modulate the concentration of endogenous estrogens by binding or inactivating some enzymes and may affect the bioavailability of sex hormones by depressing or stimulating the synthesis of sex hormonebinding globulin SHBG Emerging evidence shows that some phytoestrogens bind to and transactivate peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors PPARs In vitro studies show an activation of PPARs at concentrations above 1 ŒºM which is higher than the activation level of ERs At the concentration below 1 ŒºM activation of ERs may play a dominant role At higher concentrations gt1 ŒºM both ERs and PPARs are activated Studies have shown that both ERs and PPARs influence each other and therefore induce differential effects in a dosedependent way The final biological effects of genistein are determined by the balance among these pleiotrophic actions Ecology These compounds in plants are an important part of their defense system mainly against fungi Phytoestrogens are ancient naturally occurring substances and as dietary phytochemicals they are considered as coevolutive with mammals In the human diet phytoestrogens are not the only source of exogenous estrogens Xenoestrogens novel manmade are found as food additives and ingredients and also in cosmetics plastics and insecticides Environmentally they have similar effects as phytoestrogens making it difficult to clearly separate the action of these two kind of agents in studies done on populations Avian studies The consumption of plants with unusual content of phytoestrogens under drought conditions has been shown to decrease fertility in quail Parrot food as available in nature has shown only weak estrogenic activity Studies have been conducted on screening methods for environmental estrogens present in manufactured supplementary food with the purpose to enable reproduction of endangered species Food sources According to a study by Canadian researchers about the content of nine common phytoestrogens in a Western diet foods with the highest relative phytoestrogen content were nuts and oilseeds followed by soy products cereals and breads legumes meat products and other processed foods that may contain soy vegetables fruits alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages Flax seed and other oilseeds contained the highest total phytoestrogen content followed by soybeans and tofu The highest concentrations of isoflavones are found in soybeans and soybean products followed by legumes whereas lignans are the primary source of phytoestrogens found in nuts and oilseeds eg flax and also found in cereals legumes fruits and vegetables Phytoestrogen content varies in different foods and may vary significantly within the same group of foods eg soy beverages tofu depending on processing mechanisms and type of soybean used Legumes in particular soybeans whole grain cereals and some seeds are high in phytoestrogens A more comprehensive list of foods known to contain phytoestrogens includes  An epidemiological study of women in the United States found that the dietary intake of phytoestrogens in healthy postmenopausal Caucasian women is less than one milligram daily Effects on humans In human beings phytoestrogens are readily absorbed circulate in plasma and are excreted in the urine Metabolic influence is different from that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus monogastric digestive systems A wide range of beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on the cardiovascular metabolic central nervous systems as well as reduction of risk of cancer and post menopausal symptoms have been claimed However there is also concern that phytoestrogens may act as endocrine disruptors that adversely affect health Based on currently available evidence it is not clear whether the potential health benefits of phytoestrogens outweigh their risks Males It is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on male sexuality with conflicting results about the potential effects of isoflavones originating from soy A 2010 metaanalysis of fifteen placebocontrolled studies said that neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone concentrations in men Some studies showed that isoflavone supplementation had no effect on sperm concentration count or motility and had no effects on testicular or ejaculate volume Sperm count decline and increasing rate of testicular cancers in the West may be linked to a higher presence of isoflavone phytoestrogens in the diet but such a link has not been definitively proven Furthermore there is some evidence that phytoestrogens may affect male fertility but further investigation is needed before a firm conclusion can be drawn Females It is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on the cause or prevention of cancer in females Some epidemiological studies have suggested a protective effect against breast cancer Other epidemiological studies found that consumption of soy estrogens is safe for patients with breast cancer and that it may decrease mortality and recurrence rates It remains unclear if phytoestrogens can minimize some of the deleterious effects of low estrogen levels hypoestrogenism resulting from oophorectomy menopause or other causes A Cochrane Review of the use of phytoestrogens to relieve the vasomotor symptoms of menopause hot flashes stated that there was no conclusive evidence to suggest any benefit to their use although genistein effects should be further investigated Infant formula Some studies have found that some concentrations of isoflavones may have effects on intestinal cells At low doses genistein acted as a weak estrogen and stimulated cell growth at high doses it inhibited proliferation and altered cell cycle dynamics This biphasic response correlates with how genistein is thought to exert its effects Some reviews express the opinion that more research is needed to answer the question of what effect phytoestrogens may have on infants but their authors did not find any adverse effects Studies conclude there are no adverse effects in human growth development or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soybased infant formula compared to conventional cowmilk formula Soy formula presents no more risk than cowmilk formula One of these studies published at the Journal of Nutrition concludes that  Comprehensive literature reviews and clinical studies of infants fed SBIFs soybased infant formulas have resolved questions or raise no clinical concerns with respect to nutritional adequacy sexual development neurobehavioral development immune development or thyroid disease SBIFs provide complete nutrition that adequately supports normal infant growth and development FDA has accepted SBIFs as safe for use as the sole source of nutrition  Clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics state although isolated soy proteinbased formulas may be used to provide nutrition for normal growth and development there are few indications for their use in place of cow milkbased formula These indications include a for infants with galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency rare and b in situations in which a vegetarian diet is preferred Ethnopharmacology In some countries phytoestrogenic plants have been used for centuries in the treatment of menstrual and menopausal problems as well as for fertility problems Plants used that have been shown to contain phytoestrogens include Pueraria mirifica and its close relative kudzu Angelica fennel and anise In a rigorous study the use of one such source of phytoestrogen red clover has been shown to be safe but ineffective in relieving menopausal symptoms black cohosh is also used for menopausal symptoms but does not contain phytoestrogens Panax Ginseng contains phytoestrogens and has been used for menopausal symptoms  See also Ethnopharmacology Isoflavones Lignan Mycoestrogens Phytoandrogens Soy Xenoestrogens External links Phytoestrogen food sources Phytoestrogen content in food Phytoestrogens

modalities and environmental practices that can help people attain vibrant health Founded in 1952 it was first known as the Santa Barbara Medical Research Foundation and later renamed the Weston A Price Memorial Foundation in 1965 after the 20th century researcher Weston Price who emphasized the importance of nutrition for health and dentistry The other half of the foundations current namesake is Francis M Pottenger Jr whose study of nutrition in cats sparked interest in a diet high in raw animal products including uncooked meats and unpasteurized dairy In 1969 after Prices death the organization became the Price Pottenger Foundation and then the Price Pottenger Nutrition Foundation which it bears today PPNF primarily advocates 1 that consumption of animal fats is not dangerous to human health and 2 that mainstream agricultural methods which emphasize the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides as well as factory farming and significant processing of whole foods reduces overall nutritional quality of food and human health The first set of claims go against the mainstream scientific consensus among researchers doctors and nutritionists that a diet high in saturated fat presents serious risks to cardiovascular health and longevity The second set of claims is aligned with the increasingly popular organic food movement although major food growers and producers consistently affirm the taste and nutritional quality of their food as identical or better than organics PPNF now houses over 10000 books and publications including the works of Dr Royal Lee Dr Melvin

development of preindustrial populations including tribal Africans and Pacific islanders Inuit North and South American natives and Australian aborigines The book contains numerous photographs of the people he studied and includes comparison photographs of the teeth and facial structure of people who lived on their traditional diet and people who had adopted or grown up on industrialized food In certain instances it was possible for Price to examine and photograph traditional and industrialized eaters from the same family Francis M Pottenger Jr  Pottenger was a doctor whose 19321942 Pottenger Cat Study addressed the nutritive value of heatlabile elements ‚Äî nutrients destroyed by heat and available only in raw foods Pottenger used donated laboratory cats to test the potency of the adrenal extract hormones he was making The adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments and Pottenger noted that most of the cats died during or following the operation He was feeding the cats a supposedly nutritive diet consisting of raw milk cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps of liver tripe sweetbread brains heart and muscle When the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available Pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from a local meat packing plant including organs meat and bone and fed a separate group of cats from this supply Within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group Pottenger conducted subsequent studies involving approximately 900 cats over a period of ten years with three generations of cats studied His

       "  'raw page text': 'Probiotics are defined to be nonpathogenic strains of organism that are incorporated into the diet to modify gut microbial ecology leading to beneficial structural and functional changes in the gut Some probiotics may serve as a barrier for the colonization of pathogens to prevent disease and enhance the immune system In addition some may carry out metabolic functions such as helping the fermentation of nondigestible fibres and storing energy in the form of shortchain fatty acids Of all the types of gut microbiota Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli are considered the two most essential bacteria beneficial to human health while Staphylococci and Clostridia are considered pathogenic to human health    Health effects Diarrhea As many prevention methods for diarrhea have adverse effects eg intestinal intussusception in the usage of rotavirus vaccine scientists are now turning to probiotics in hope of using it as a supplement to treat acute diarrhea In a review that covered 34 masked randomized placebocontrolled trials related to diarrhea and probiotics it was concluded that there was an overall reduction of 52 in antibiotic associated diarrhea an 8 reduction in traveller‚Äôs diarrhea and a 34 reduction in other types of acute diarrhea These numbers reflect a protective effect against diarrhea in subjects including both adults and children In terms of children age lt 18 years seven out of the 12 trials conducted in a health care setting showed a reduction in acute diarrhea of 57 There was no significant difference in the protective effect of strains namely Saccharomyces boulardii Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus Probiotics were found to be effective in treating acute infectious diarrhea in children when a review was completed in 2001 involving gt 700 children aged from one to 48 months with acute diarrhea A 2002 review showed that Lactobacillus reduced the average duration of acute diarrhea by 07 days and stool frequency by 16 on the second day of treatment Dosage was most effective at more than ten billion colonyforming units of Lactobacillus during the first 48 hours of diarrhea Moreover there has been evidence showing that probiotics can prevent children and infants from gastroenteritis also known as stomach flu which may also cause diarrhea to occur Antibioticassociated diarrhea  This illness can generally be accounted for by Clostridium difficile a bacterium that can sometimes cause severe diarrhea known as pseudomembranous colitis In a review of six trials related to antibioticassociated diarrhea in 766 children aged one month to six years there was an overall reduction in AAD when children were fed probiotics The reduction when compared to placebo was seen to be from 285 to 119 in fact when patients were fed probiotics along with their dose of antibiotics one fewer patient would develop AAD out of every seven Antibiotics fed to the children in the trials included amoxicillin penicillin and erythromycin Evidence suggests that S boulardii is best at preventing AAD in children Lactobacillus GG ranking second and a mixture of S thermophilus and B lactis relatively ranking last No conclusion can be made on how probiotics can reduce the risk of AAD from any specific types of antibiotic One of the proposed mechanisms of how probiotics protect from AAD is by regulating the composition of organisms in the intestines Studies involving L acidophilus and Bifidobacterium suggest that these microbes inhibit the growth of facultative anaerobic bacteria which tends to increase during antibiotic treatment As a result it is seen that probiotics can alter and prevent changes in the intestinal microflora caused by antibiotics Viral diarrhea  Viral diarrhea refers to the type of diarrhea that is caused by a rotavirus a virus often impacting toddlers and infants A metaanalysis of nine previously conducted studies those studies were conducted in Canada Thailand and Finland has shown that certain types of probiotics are also effective in treating viral diarrhea in hospitaladmitted children Subjects of those studies ranged from one to above 36 months old The study results showed that the duration of the illness was shortened by 07 days on average when placing the children on Lactobacillus therapy Although it is still largely unknown as to how probiotics do this two mechanisms have been currently proposed The first mechanism suggests that Lactobacilli augment the development of intestinal mucins glyosylated proteins which consequently protect the body from intestinal infections Persistent diarrhea A 2013 review suggested probiotics are effective in treating persistent diarrhea in children though more research is needed Persistent diarrhea is an episode that starts acutely but then lasts for 14 days or more In developing countries it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five years old The study showed average duration reduced by four days and shorter hospital stay stool frequency was reduced on the fifth day Allergy Probiotics are commonly given to breastfeeding mothers and their young children to prevent eczema but some doubt exists over the strength of evidence supporting this practice Safety Documented correlations between systemic infections and probiotic consumption are few and all occurred in patients with underlying medical conditions Rarely consumption of probiotics may cause bacteremia fungemia and sepsis in children with lowered immune systems who are already critically ill There are no adverse effects from Lactobacillus ingestion References  External links Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probiotics in Food 2002 ',\n",

much energy density as carbohydrates 4 kcal 17 kJ per gram in contrast lipids provide 9 kcal 37 kJ per gram The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition Proteins are polymer chains made of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds During human digestion proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller polypeptide chains via hydrochloric acid and protease actions This is crucial for the absorption of the essential amino acids that cannot be biosynthesized by the body There are nine essential amino acids which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent proteinenergy malnutrition and resulting death They are phenylalanine valine threonine tryptophan methionine leucine isoleucine lysine and histidine There has been debate as to whether there are 8 or 9 essential amino acids The consensus seems to lean towards 9 since Histidine is not synthesized in adults There are five dispensable amino acids which humans are able to synthesize in the body These five are alanine aspartic acid asparagine glutamic acid and serine There are six conditionally essential amino acids whose synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress These six are arginine cysteine glycine glutamine proline and tyrosine Some protein sources contain amino acids in a more or less complete sense This has given rise to various ranking systems for protein sources as described in the article Dietary sources of protein include both animals and plants meats dairy products fish and eggs as well as grains legumes and nuts Vegans can get enough essential amino acids by eating a variety of plant proteins It is commonly believed that athletes should consume a higherthannormal protein intake to maintain optimal physical performance    Protein functions in body Protein is a nutrient needed by the human body for growth and maintenance Aside from water proteins are the most abundant kind of molecules in the body Protein can be found in all cells of the body and is the major structural component of all cells in the body especially muscle This also includes body organs hair and skin Proteins are also used in membranes such as glycoproteins When broken down into amino acids they are used as precursors to nucleic acid coenzymes hormones immune response cellular repair and other molecules essential for life Additionally protein is needed to form blood cells Sources  Protein can be found in a wide range of food The best combination of protein sources depends on the region of the world access cost amino acid types and nutrition balance as well as acquired tastes Some foods are high in certain amino acids but their digestibility and the antinutritional factors present in these foods make them of limited value in human nutrition Therefore one must consider digestibility and secondary nutrition profile such as calories cholesterol vitamins and essential mineral density of the protein source On a worldwide basis plant protein foods contribute over 60 percent of the per capita supply of protein on average In North America animalderived foods contribute about 70 percent of protein sources Meat products from milk eggs soy and fish are sources of complete protein Whole grains and cereals are another source of proteins However these tend to be limiting in the amino acid lysine or threonine which are available in other vegetarian sources and meats Examples of food staples and cereal sources of protein each with a concentration greater than 70 are in no particular order buckwheat oats rye millet maize corn rice wheat sorghum amaranth and quinoa Vegetarian sources of proteins include legumes nuts seeds and fruits Legumes some of which are called pulses in certain parts of the world have higher concentrations of amino acids and are more complete sources of protein than whole grains and cereals Examples of vegetarian foods with protein concentrations greater than 7 percent include soybeans lentils kidney beans white beans mung beans chickpeas cowpeas lima beans pigeon peas lupines wing beans almonds Brazil nuts cashews pecans walnuts cotton seeds pumpkin seeds hemp seeds sesame seeds and sunflower seeds    Food staples that are poor sources of protein include roots and tubers such as yams cassava and sweet potato Plantains another major staple are also a poor source of essential amino acids Fruits while rich in other essential nutrients are another poor source of amino acids The protein content in roots tubers and fruits is between 0 and 2 percent Food staples with low protein content must be complemented with foods with complete quality protein content for a healthy life particularly in children for proper development A good source of protein is often a combination of various foods because different foods are rich in different amino acids A good source of dietary protein meets two requirements The requirement for the nutritionally indispensable amino acids histidine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine tryptophan and valine under all conditions and for conditionally indispensable amino acids cystine tyrosine taurine glycine arginine glutamine proline under specific physiological and pathological conditions The requirement for nonspecific nitrogen for the synthesis of the nutritionally dispensable amino acids aspartic acid asparagine glutamic acid alanine serine and other physiologically important nitrogencontaining compounds such as nucleic acids creatine and porphyrins Healthy people eating a balanced diet rarely need protein supplements The table below presents the most important food groups as protein sources from a worldwide perspective It also lists their respective performance as source of the commonly limiting amino acids in milligrams of limiting amino acid per gram of total protein in the food source The table reiterates the need for a balanced mix of foods to ensure adequate amino acid source  Protein powders ‚Äì such as casein whey egg rice and soy ‚Äì are processed and manufactured sources of protein These protein powders may provide an additional source of protein for bodybuilders The type of protein is important in terms of its influence on protein metabolic response and possibly on the muscles exercise performance The different physical andor chemical properties within the various types of protein may affect the rate of protein digestion As a result the amino acid availability and the accumulation of tissue protein is altered because of the various protein metabolic responses Protein quality  The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition There are multiple systems which rate proteins by their usefulness to an organism based on their relative percentage of amino acids and in some systems the digestibility of the protein source They include biological value net protein utilization and PDCAAS Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acids Score Also see complete protein nitrogen balance and protein combining The PDCAAS was developed by the FDA as an improvement over the Protein efficiency ratio PER method The PDCAAS rating is a fairly recent evaluation method it was adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United NationsWorld Health Organization FAOWHO in 1993 as the preferred best method to determine protein quality These organizations have suggested that other methods for evaluating the quality of protein are inferior Digestion Most proteins are decomposed to single amino acids by digestion in the gastrointestinal tract Digestion typically begins in the stomach when pepsinogen is converted to pepsin by the action of hydrochloric acid and continued by trypsin and chymotrypsin in the small intestine Before the absorption in the small intestine most proteins are already reduced to single amino acid or peptides of several amino acids Most peptides longer than four amino acids are not absorbed Absorption into the intestinal absorptive cells is not the end There most of the peptides are broken into single amino acids Absorption of the amino acids and their derivatives into which dietary protein is degraded is done by the gastrointestinal tract The absorption rates of individual amino acids are highly dependent on the protein source for example the digestibilities of many amino acids in humans the difference between soy and milk proteins and between individual milk proteins betalactoglobulin and casein For milk proteins about 50 of the ingested protein is absorbed between the stomach and the jejunum and 90 is absorbed by the time the digested food reaches the ileum Biological value BV is a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organisms body Newborn Newborns of mammals are exceptional in protein digestion and assimilation in that they can absorb intact proteins at the small intestine This enables passive immunity ie transfer of immunoglobulins from the mother to the newborn via milk Dietary requirements  Considerable debate has taken place regarding issues surrounding protein intake requirements The amount of protein required in a persons diet is determined in large part by overall energy intake the bodys need for nitrogen and essential amino acids body weight and composition rate of growth in the individual physical activity level individuals energy and carbohydrate intake as well as the presence of illness or injury Physical activity and exertion as well as enhanced muscular mass increase the need for protein Requirements are also greater during childhood for growth and development during pregnancy or when breastfeeding in order to nourish a baby or when the body needs to recover from malnutrition or trauma or after an operation If not enough energy is taken in through diet as in the process of starvation the body will use protein from the muscle mass to meet its energy needs leading to muscle wasting over time If the individual does not consume adequate protein in nutrition then muscle will also waste as more vital cellular processes eg respiration enzymes blood cells recycle muscle protein for their own requirements Dietary Recommendations According to US amp Canadian Dietary Reference Intake guidelines women aged 19‚Äì70 need to consume 46\\xa0grams of protein per day while men aged 19‚Äì70 need to consume 56\\xa0grams of protein per day to minimize risk of deficiency These Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs were calculated based on 08 grams protein per kilogram body weight and average body weights of 57\\xa0kg 126 pounds and 70\\xa0kg 154 pounds respectively However this recommendation is based on structural requirements but disregards use of protein for energy metabolism This requirement is for a normal sedentary person In the United States average protein consumption is higher than the RDA According to the most recently published results of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 20132014 average protein consumption for women ages 20 and older was 698 grams and for men 983 gramsday Active people Several studies have concluded that active people and athletes may require elevated protein intake compared to 08 gkg due to increase in muscle mass and sweat losses as well as need for body repair and energy source Suggested amounts vary between 16 gkg and 18 gkg while a proposed maximum daily protein intake would be approximately 25 of energy requirements ie approximately 2 to 25 gkg However many questions still remain to be resolved In addition some have suggested that athletes using restrictedcalorie diets for weight loss should further increase their protein consumption possibly to 18‚Äì20 gkg in order to avoid loss of lean muscle mass Aerobic exercise protein needs Endurance athletes differ from strengthbuilding athletes in that endurance athletes do not build as much muscle mass from training as strengthbuilding athletes do Research suggests that individuals performing endurance activity require more protein intake than sedentary individuals so that muscles broken down during endurance workouts can be repaired Although the protein requirement for athletes still remains controversial for instance see Lamont Nutrition Research Reviews pages 142  149 2012 research does show that endurance athletes can benefit from increasing protein intake because the type of exercise endurance athletes participate in still alters the protein metabolism pathway The overall protein requirement increases because of amino acid oxidation in endurancetrained athletes Endurance athletes who exercise over a long period 2‚Äì5 hours per training session use protein as a source of 5‚Äì10 of their total energy expended Therefore a slight increase in protein intake may be beneficial to endurance athletes by replacing the protein lost in energy expenditure and protein lost in repairing muscles Some scientists suggest that endurance athletes may increase daily protein intake to a maximum of 12‚Äì14 g per kg body weight Anaerobic exercise protein needs Research also indicates that individuals performing strengthtraining activity require more protein than sedentary individuals Strengthtraining athletes may increase their daily protein intake to a maximum of 14‚Äì18 g per kg body weight to enhance muscle protein synthesis or to make up for the loss of amino acid oxidation during exercise Many athletes maintain a highprotein diet as part of their training In fact some athletes who specialize in anaerobic sports eg weightlifting believe a very high level of protein intake is necessary and so consume high protein meals and also protein supplements Special populations Protein allergies  A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to proteins in food The signs and symptoms may range from mild to severe They may include itchiness swelling of the tongue vomiting diarrhea hives trouble breathing or low blood pressure These symptoms typically occurs within minutes to one hour after exposure When the symptoms are severe it is known as anaphylaxis The following eight foods are responsible for about 90 of allergic reactions cows milk eggs wheat shellfish fish peanuts tree nuts and soy Phenylketonuria Individuals with phenylketonuria PKU must keep their intake of phenylalanine  an essential amino acid  extremely low to prevent a mental disability and other metabolic complications Phenylalanine is a component of the artificial sweetener aspartame so people with PKU need to avoid low calorie beverages and foods with this ingredient Maple syrup urine disease Maple syrup urine disease is associated with genetic anomalies in the metabolism of branchedchain amino acids BCAAs They have high blood levels of BCAAs and must severely restrict their intake of BCAAs in order to prevent mental retardation and death The amino acids in question are leucine isoleucine and valine The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants urine Children of Amish Mennonite and Ashkenazi Jewish descent have a high prevalence of this disease compared to other populations Excess consumption The US and Canadian Dietary Reference Intake review for protein concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to establish a Tolerable upper intake level ie an upper limit for how much protein can be safely consumed The body is unable to store excess protein Dietary protein is converted to individual amino acids by the digestive process which are then absorbed When amino acids are in excess of needs the liver takes up the amino acids and subjects them to deamination a process that converts the nitrogen from the amino acids into ammonia further processed in the liver into urea via the urea cycle Excretion of urea is performed by the kidneys Other parts of the amino acid molecules can be converted into glucose and used for fuel When food protein intake is periodically high or low the body tries to keep protein levels at an equilibrium by using the labile protein reserve to compensate for daily variations in protein intake However unlike body fat as a reserve for future caloric needs there is no protein storage for future needs Research has supported a theory that excessive intake of protein increases calcium excretion in urine occurring to compensate for the pH imbalance from oxidation of sulfur amino acids This may lead to a higher risk of kidney stone formation from calcium in the renal circulatory system In theory this calcium excretion from bone resorption could contribute to osteoporosis but a metaanalysis by the National Osteoporosis Foundation reported no adverse effects of higher protein intakes on bone density A metaanalysis reported a small decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with diets higher in protein with no differences between animal and plant protein The 2015‚Äì2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that men and teenage boys increase their consumption of fruits vegetables and other underconsumed foods and that a means of accomplishing this would be to reduce overall intake of protein foods Testing in foods The classic assays for protein concentration in food are the Kjeldahl method and the Dumas method These tests determine the total nitrogen in a sample The only major component of most food which contains nitrogen is protein fat carbohydrate and dietary fiber do not contain nitrogen If the amount of nitrogen is multiplied by a factor depending on the kinds of protein expected in the food the total protein can be determined This value is known as the crude protein content On food labels the protein is given by the nitrogen multiplied by 625 because the average nitrogen content of proteins is about 16 The Kjeldahl test is typically used because it is the method the AOAC International has adopted and is therefore used by many food standards agencies around the world though the Dumas method is also approved by some standards organizations Accidental contamination and intentional adulteration of protein meals with nonprotein nitrogen sources that inflate crude protein content measurements have been known to occur in the food industry for decades To ensure food quality purchasers of protein meals routinely conduct quality control tests designed to detect the most common nonprotein nitrogen contaminants such as urea and ammonium nitrate In at least one segment of the food industry the dairy industry some countries at least the US Australia France and Hungary have adopted true protein measurement as opposed to crude protein measurement as the standard for payment and testing True protein is a measure of only the proteins in milk whereas crude protein is a measure of all sources of nitrogen and includes nonprotein nitrogen such as urea which has no food value to humans  Current milktesting equipment measures peptide bonds a direct measure of true protein Measuring peptide bonds in grains has also been put into practice in several countries including Canada the UK Australia Russia and Argentina where nearinfrared reflectance NIR technology a type of infrared spectroscopy is used The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO recommends that only amino acid analysis be used to determine protein in inter alia foods used as the sole source of nourishment such as infant formula but also provides When data on amino acids analyses are not available determination of protein based on total N content by Kjeldahl AOAC 2000 or similar method  is considered acceptable The limitations of the Kjeldahl method were at the heart of the Chinese protein export contamination in 2007 and the 2008 China milk scandal in which the industrial chemical melamine was added to the milk or glutens to increase the measured protein Protein deficiency   Protein deficiency and malnutrition PEM can lead to variety of ailments including mental retardation and kwashiorkor Symptoms of kwashiorkor include apathy diarrhea inactivity failure to grow flaky skin fatty liver and edema of the belly and legs This edema is explained by the action of lipoxygenase on arachidonic acid to form leukotrienes and the normal functioning of proteins in fluid balance and

       "  'raw page text': 'Protein combining also protein complementing is a dietary strategy for protein nutrition by using complementary sources to optimize biological value and increase the protein quality It was originally applied to livestock feed for animal nutrition Sometimes it is used as a critique of low or supposedly insufficient essential amino acids contents of vegetarian and vegan dishes and dietsStudies on essential amino acid contents in plant proteins has shown that vegetarian and vegans do not need to complement plants in each meal to reach the desired level of essential amino acids as long as their diets are varied The American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada support this position The terms complete and incomplete are misleading in relation to plant protein Protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough of all indispensable essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met    Concept Protein nutrition is complex because any proteinogenic amino acid may be the limiting factor in metabolism Mixing livestock feeds can optimize for growth or minimize cost while maintaining adequate growth Similarly human nutrition is subject to Liebigs law of the minimum The lowest level of one of the essential amino acids will be the limiting factor in metabolism If the content of a single indispensable amino acid in the diet is less than the individual‚Äôs requirement then it will limit the utilization of other amino acids and thus prevent the normal rates of synthesis even when the total nitrogen intake level is adequate Thus the limiting amino acid will determine the nutritional value of the total nitrogen or protein in the diet Plants are thus rated as protein sources by their limiting amino acids Examples of limiting amino acids in plant protein According to WHO human need for proteins is defined as 066 g per kg of body mass per day That is in the example a person of 70\\xa0kg mass has an estimated need of protein of 70\\xa0kg  066 gkg  462 g In addition there is a specific need of essential amino acids quantities thereby written in the table In the above example whole rice has Lysine as limiting amino acids that means that only consuming whole rice in this specific quantity of 612gday and not more for long periods of time may result indeed in lysine deficiency In the above example canned chickpeas has all essential amino acids and even consuming only this specific food in this specific quantity of 522gday would not result in any of the essential amino acid deficiency As the data of the example show all essential amino acids are found in a specific plant however one of them may or may not be limiting that is present in quantities below the WHO daily recommendation For this reasons vegan and vegetarian diets need to be varied in terms of plants consumed Plant protein research The first biochemist to enter the field was Karl Heinrich Ritthausen a student of Justus von Liebig Thomas Burr Osborne continued what Ritthausen started and published The Vegetable Proteins in 1909 Thus Yale University was the early center of protein nutrition where William Cumming Rose was a student Osborne also worked to determine the essentials and later led the Biochemistry Department at the University of Chicago When Ritthausen died in 1912 Osborne praised his efforts in biochemistry As a result of his later work he proved that wide differences exist between different food proteins and he was the first to direct attention to this fact and to discuss its probable bearing on their relative value in nutrition Osborne then joined forces with Lafayette Mendel at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station to determine the essential amino acids In the 1950s and 1960s Nevin S Scrimshaw took this knowledge to India and Guatemala He designed meals using local vegetables to fight against the scourge of kwashiorkor In Guatemala he used the combination of cottonseed flour with maize while in India he combined peanut flour with wheat Popularization In 1954 Adelle Davis published Lets Eat Right to Keep Fit which described the importance of combining incomplete proteins to make complete proteins and advised that any incomplete proteins not complemented within one hour could not be used by the body In 1971 Frances Moore Lapp√© published Diet for a Small Planet which explained how essential amino acids might be obtained from complementary sources in vegetarian nutrition The book became a bestseller\\xa0 An extension of a onepage handout that Lapp√© had circulated among her fellow improvisors in Berkeley Diet for a Small Planet 1971 soon became the vegetarian text of the ecology movement selling in the next ten years almost two million copies in three editions and six languages Lapp√© wrote Complementary protein combinations make for delicious recipes ‚Äì they are combinations that formed the basis of the world‚Äôs traditional cuisines We use them naturally in our cooking without even being aware of it The three most common complementary protein combinations are Grains rice corn wheat barley etc  legumes peas beans lentils Grains and milk products Seeds Sesame or sunflower legumes  In 1975 both Vogue and American Journal of Nursing carried articles describing the principles and practice of protein combining For a time The American National Research Council and the American Dietetic Association ADA cautioned vegetarians to be sure to combine their proteins In 1985 the principle of protein combining was explained by J Rig√≥ The biological value of proteins in general hence also of grainproteins is fundamentally determined by the ratio between the essential amino acids to be found in cereals and the requirement of essential amino acids of the living creature consuming proteinthe most important way of raising the biological value  is given by the technique of complementing In 2011 PLOS ONEpublished an article investigating the specifics of protein combining for 1251 plantbased foods The bases of reference are the amino acids indispensable to human nutrition and the ideal proportioning of these amino acids in a meal They explain complementation involves consuming two or more foods together to yield an amino acid pattern that is better than the sum of the two foods alone In contrast to pairings based on food groups such as pairing a grain with a bean the investigators reported that pairing by food group was not supported by their work Examining the top 100 pairings for each food we found no consistent pattern of food groupfood group pairings Criticism Protein combining has drawn criticism as an unnecessary complicating factor in nutrition In 1981 Lapp√© changed her position on protein combining in a revised edition of Diet for a Small Planet in which she wrote In 1971 I stressed protein complementarity because I assumed that the only way to get enough protein  was to create a protein as usable by the body as animal protein In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get highquality protein I reinforced another myth I gave the impression that in order to get enough protein without meat considerable care was needed in choosing foods Actually it is much easier than I thought With three important exceptions there is little danger of protein deficiency in a plant food diet The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on 1 fruit or on 2 some tubers such as sweet potatoes or cassava or on 3 junk food refined flours sugars and fat Fortunately relatively few people in the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories In all other diets if people are getting enough calories they are virtually certain of getting enough protein Necessity of protein combining was not asserted Rather the increased biological value of meals where proteins are combined was noted In a concession Lapp√© removed from the second edition charts that indicate exact proportions of complementary proteins The American Dietetic Association reversed itself in its 1988 position paper on vegetarianism Suzanne Havala the primary author of the paper recalls the research process There was no basis for protein combining that I could see I began calling around and talking to people and asking them what the justification was for saying that you had to complement proteins and there was none And what I got instead was some interesting insight from people who were knowledgeable and actually felt that there was probably no need to complement proteins So we went ahead and made that change in the paper Note The paper was approved by peer review and by a delegation vote before becoming official In 1994 Vernon Young and Peter Pellett published their paper that became the definitive contemporary guide to protein metabolism in humans It also confirmed that complementing proteins at meals was totally unnecessary Thus people who avoid consuming animal protein do not need to be at all concerned about amino acid imbalances from the plant proteins that make up their usual diets While many plant proteins are lower in one or more essential amino acids than animal proteins especially lysine and to a lesser extent methionine and threonine eating a variety of plants can serve as a wellbalanced and complete source of amino acids Pediatrician Charles R Attwood wrote The old ideas about the necessity of carefully combining vegetables at every meal to ensure the supply of essential amino acids has been totally refuted In 2002 Dr John McDougall wrote a correction to the American Heart Association for a 2001 publication that questioned the completeness of plant proteins and further asserted that it is impossible to design an amino acid‚Äìdeficient diet based on the amounts of unprocessed starches and vegetables sufficient to meet the calorie needs of humans Later that year Dr Andrew Weil wrote that you don‚Äôt have to worry that you won‚Äôt get enough usable protein if you don‚Äôt put together some magical combination of foods at each meal In Healthy Times Jeff Novick wrote that the necessity of protein combining is a myth that won‚Äôt go away In 2005 Dr Joel Fuhrman wrote plant foods have plenty of protein and you do not have to be a nutritional scientist or dietitian to figure out what to eat and you don‚Äôt need to mix and match foods to achieve protein completeness Any combination of natural foods will supply you with adequate protein including all eight essential amino acids as well as unessential amino acids Dr T Colin Campbell wrote in 2006 We now know that through enormously complex metabolic systems the human body can derive all the essential amino acids from the natural variety of plant proteins that we encounter every day It doesn‚Äôt require eating higher quantities of plant protein or meticulously planning every meal In 2009 the American Dietetic Association wrote Plant protein can meet protein requirements when a variety of plant foods is consumed and energy needs are met Research indicates that an assortment of plant foods eaten over the course of a day can provide all essential amino acids and ensure adequate nitrogen retention and use in healthy adults thus complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same meal The American Heart Association now states You don‚Äôt need to eat foods from animals to have enough protein in your diet Plant proteins alone can provide enough of the essential and nonessential amino acids as long as sources of dietary protein are varied and caloric intake is high enough to meet energy needs Whole grains legumes vegetables seeds and nuts all contain both essential and nonessential amino acids You don‚Äôt need to consciously combine these foods ‚Äúcomplementary proteins‚Äù within a given meal Some institutions use the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score to assess diets without consideration of protein combining and hence find the use of combinations to be a challenge to their methodology References  External links When Your Friends

       "  'raw page text': 'Protein digestibilitycorrected amino acid score PDCAAS is a method of evaluating the quality of a protein based on both the amino acid requirements of humans and their ability to digest it The PDCAAS rating was adopted by the US FDA and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United NationsWorld Health Organization FAOWHO in 1993 as the preferred best method to determine protein quality In 2013 FAO proposed changing to Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score    Methodology Using the PDCAAS method the protein quality rankings are determined by comparing the amino acid profile of the specific food protein against a standard amino acid profile with the highest possible score being a 10 This score means after digestion of the protein it provides per unit of protein 100 or more of the indispensable amino acids required The formula for calculating the PDCAAS percentage is mg of limiting amino acid in 1 g of test protein  mg of same amino acid in 1 g of reference protein x fecal true digestibility percentage The PDCAAS value is different from measuring the quality of protein from the protein efficiency ratio PER and the biological value BV methods The PER was based upon the amino acid requirements of growing rats which noticeably differ from those of humans The PDCAAS allows evaluation of food protein quality based on the needs of humans as it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements adjusted for digestibility of a 2 to 5yearold child considered the most nutritionally demanding age group The BV method uses nitrogen absorption as a basis However it does not take into account certain factors influencing the digestion of the protein and is of limited use for application to human protein requirements because what is measured is maximal potential of quality and not a true estimate of quality at requirement level Nevertheless BV can be used to assess requirements of protein derived from foods with known quality differences and measure the proportion of absorbed nitrogen which is retained and presumably used for protein synthesis as an accurate indicator for protein measurement The FDA gave two reasons for adopting the PDCAAS in 1993 1 PDCAAS is based on human amino acid requirements which makes it more appropriate for humans than a method based on the amino acid needs of animals 2 The Food and Agricultural OrganizationWorld Health Organization FAOWHO had previously recommended PDCAAS for regulatory purposes Limitations Digestion Amino acids that move beyond the terminal ileum in the body are less likely to be absorbed for use in protein synthesis They may pass out of the body or may be absorbed by bacteria thus will not be present in the feces and will appear to have been digested The PDCAAS takes no account of where the proteins have been digested Similarly amino acids that are lost due to antinutritional factors present in many foods are assumed to be digested according to the PDCAAS Due to this in 2013 the FAO proposed changing to Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score Focus on single proteins The PDCAAS method may also still be considered incomplete since human diets except in times of famine almost never contain only one kind of protein However calculating the PDCAAS of a diet solely based on the PDCAAS of the individual constituents is impossible because one food may provide an abundance of an amino acid that the other is missing in which case the PDCAAS of the diet is higher than that of any one of the constituents To arrive at the final result all individual amino acids would have to be taken into account though so the PDCAAS of each constituent is largely useless For example grain protein has a PDCAAS of about 04 to 05 limited by lysine On the other hand it contains more than enough methionine White bean protein and that of many other pulses has a PDCAAS of 06 to 07 limited by methionine and contains more than enough lysine When both are eaten in roughly equal quantities in a diet the PDCAAS of the combined constituent is 10 because each constituents protein is complemented by the other A more extreme example would be the combination of gelatine which contains virtually no tryptophan and thus has a PDCAAS of 0 with isolated tryptophan which lacking all other essential amino acids also has a PDCAAS of 0 Despite individual scores of 0 the combination of both in adequate amounts has a positive PDCAAS with the limiting amino acids isoleucine threonine and methionine Further according to a 2000 study by Gerjan Schaafsma The questions about the validity of the amino acid scoring pattern and the application of the true fecal rather than the true ileal digestibility correction as well as the truncation of PDCAAS values warrant a critical evaluation of PDCAAS in its current form as a measure of protein quality in human diets Also the scientific community has raised critical questions about the validity of PDCAAS the validity of the preschoolage child amino acid scoring pattern the validity of the true fecal digestibility correction and the truncation of PDCAAS values to 100 Capped score In addition the fact that four proteins all with different amino acid profiles receive identical scores of 10 limits its usefulness as a comparative tool Since they have different compositions it is natural to assume that they perform differently in the human body and should have different scores In short this method however gives no distinction of their performance relative to each other because after they pass a certain point they are all capped at 10 and receive an identical rating This is because in 1990 at a FAOWHO meeting it was decided that proteins having values higher than 10 would be rounded or leveled down to 10 as scores above 10 are considered to indicate the protein contains essential amino acids in excess of the human requirements Example values A PDCAAS value of 1 is the highest and 0 the lowest The table shows the ratings of selected foods See also Amino acid score Protein quality Net protein utilization Nitrogen balance References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Proteinogenic amino acids are amino acids that are incorporated biosynthetically into proteins during translation The word proteinogenic means protein creating Throughout known life there are 22 genetically encoded proteinogenic amino acids 20 in the standard genetic code and an additional 2 that can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms In contrast nonproteinogenic amino acids are amino acids that are either not incorporated into proteins like GABA LDOPA or triiodothyronine misincorporated in place of a genetically encoded amino acid or not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery like hydroxyproline The latter often results from posttranslational modification of proteins Some nonproteinogenic amino acids are incorporated into nonribosomal peptides which are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes can incorporate selenocysteine into their proteins via a nucleotide sequence known as a SECIS element which directs the cell to translate a nearby UGA codon as selenocysteine UGA is normally a stop codon In some methanogenic prokaryotes the UAG codon normally a stop codon can also be translated to pyrrolysine In eukaryotes there are only 21 proteinogenic amino acids the 20 of the standard genetic code plus selenocysteine Humans can synthesize 12 of these from each other or from other molecules of intermediary metabolism The other nine must be consumed usually as their protein derivatives and so they are called essential amino acids The essential amino acids are histidine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine tryptophan and valine ie H I L K M F T W V The proteinogenic amino acids have been found to be related to the set of amino acids that can be recognized by ribozyme autoaminoacylation systems Thus nonproteinogenic amino acids would have been excluded by the contingent evolutionary success of nucleotidebased life forms Other reasons have been offered to explain why certain specific nonproteinogenic amino acids are not generally incorporated into proteins for example ornithine and homoserine cyclize against the

       "  'raw page text': 'The developmental life stage of dogs requires a specific intake of nutrients to ensure proper growth and development and to meet energy requirements Despite the fact that puppies have different nutritional requirements compared to their adult counterparts of the 652 breeders surveyed in the United States and Canada in 2012 87 report feeding puppies commercial diets not intended for the developmental life stage of canines Large and small dog breeds have even more specific nutrient requirements during growth such as adjusted calcium to phosphorus ratio and as such should receive a breed specific growth formula Feeding diets formulated by a nutritionist for specific breed and life stage differences in nutrient requirements ensures a growing puppy will receive the proper nutrition associated with appropriate skeletal neurological and immune development This includes nutrients such as protein fibre essential fatty acids calcium and vitamin E It is therefore important to feed puppies a diet that meets the minimum andor maximum requirements established by the National Research Council The nutritional requirements determined by the NRC are based on scientific evidence and used as the basis for nutritional adequacy in cats and dogs However these values are based on the assumption that the availability and digestibility of the nutrients are not variable although in reality this is not the case The Association of American Feed Control Officials AAFCO also has recommended nutrient levels but their values serve primarily as regulatory guidance AAFCO bases their recommendations on feeding trials and are not necessarily supported by scientific evidence however their nutritional adequacy statement on pet food bags is considered an important part of the label because their recommendations account for ingredient variability Other agencies involved in pet food regulations include the FDA in the United States who directly regulates the sales of pet food the FEDIAF in Europe and PFIAA in Australia who recommend regulatory requirements for the pet food industry as well as others When selecting puppy food it is important to consult the labels and ensure products meet the standards of regulatory agencies of your respective country    Energy Young growing dogs require greater amounts of energy per unit body mass than fully grown adult dogs From time of weaning until the puppy reaches 40 of the adult body weight the optimal energy intake per unit body weight is twice that of an adult dog of the same breed From 40 to 80 of adult body weight energy requirements decrease to 16 times the adult requirement and from 80 to the end of growth this decreases further to 12 times the adult energy requirement Because of this it is important to ensure that puppy diets contain higher amounts of energy than adult dog foods However over nutrition associated with feeding ad libitum results in accelerated skeletal growth and weight gain leading to osteopenia especially in large breed dogs Therefore appropriate energy requirements should be met but not exceeded in the growing dog Owners and puppy raisers should monitor their puppy‚Äôs weight gain by referencing a 9 point body condition score scale which is easily accessible on the internet regularly weighing the puppy and consulting with their veterinarian Owners should also be mindful as to the energy level of their puppy high energy level puppies will require more energy and may need to be fed extra amounts of food just as lower energy puppies may require less food The 9 point body condition score has been shown to be an effective method for estimating percent body fat in dogs Therefore by adhering to the 9 point body condition scale and adjusting food intake accordingly owners will be able to maintain their puppy at an appropriate weight throughout its growth In addition to visual estimates of body condition physical palpation of the pet can provide insight on general health and weight Speaking to a licensed veterinarian can be very beneficial as they can help develop these dietary and weight monitoring skills Calcium and Phosphorus An important aspect of the composition of puppy food is the calcium and phosphorus content Bone mineral is composed mainly of calcium which functions in skeletal mineralization during growth Puppies younger than 5 months are not able to adjust the absorption of calcium in response to intake therefore an oversupply or undersupply can be harmful When raised on diets deficient in calcium pathological bone fractures can result These fractures have been shown to occur in smaller breed puppies when their diet contained less than 033 calcium on a dry matter DM basis Larger breeds present with fractures at a calcium level of less than 055 thus requiring these breeds to have greater calcium requirements The ratio of calcium to phosphorus greatly impacts the retention of phosphorus A ratio of 131 will allow for good phosphorus retention but levels above a ratio of 21 will decrease phosphorus retention Raising puppies on diets containing excess calcium and phosphorus will result in osteochondrosis which disturbs bone remodeling and cartilage and bone maturation  These changes are noticed in larger breed puppies at lower levels of excess than in smaller breeds Because large breed puppies are more sensitive to deficient and excess calcium and phosphorus levels it is important to ensure that their diets contain sufficient amounts of both The minimum requirement laid out by the NRC is 80gkg DM calcium 08 with a 12gkg DM 12 recommended allowance However recommendations laid out by AAFCO consist of slightly higher calcium values 12 to 18 on a DM basis whereas phosphorus levels should be between 10 and 16 with a ratio of calcium to phosphorus between 11 and 21 Many commonly used ingredients such as corn which are added in high amounts to commercial dog foods do not contain adequate amounts of calcium and as such calcium supplements are often added to the formulation to ensure proper amounts for development In addition a descriptive study of overthecounter maintenance dog foods determined that 445 of the foods studied contained calcium concentrations that exceeded the AAFCO recommendation but were labeled for all life stages Therefore it is important to feed a diet specifically recommended for the developmental life stage and consult the calcium and phosphorus levels in puppy foods Fats and Fatty Acids Fat is a nutrient that provides more energy per gram than all other nutrients Fat provides 94kcalg of gross energy GE compared to protein and carbohydrate which only provide 556 and 415 kcalg respectively Due to this greater energy concentration and the higher energy demand of puppies the higher fat content of canine development diets helps reach these increased energy requirements while also providing the essential fatty acids necessary for the growing dog Omega3 n3 fatty acids are an important component of puppy diets Multiple studies suggest brain and retinal function are dependent on the level of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids acquired during in utero development and postnatal life DHA is the main n3 fatty acid and can be obtained as DHA itself from dietary sources such as fish and fish oils or as the DHA precursor linolenic acid With a high DHA intake plasma lipid DHA content increases aiding neurological development as demonstrated by increases in memory and learning ability Other benefits of n3 and DHA include promotion of neurogenesis increased neuron size and phospholipid synthesis as well as protection against cell death and peroxidative brain damage by damaging free radicals in the rodent model and presumably across the mammalian kingdom A deficit of dietary n3 fatty acids leads to a reduction in brain DHA content by 5080 leading to cognitive deficits and increased n6 fatty acid level which increases inflammation Adequate intake and recommended allowance levels of 85gkg DM of total fat 85 and 05gkg DM of omega 3 fatty acids EPADHA are laid out by the NRC Both of these values are also laid out as recommendations by AAFCO However according to a study on the effects of supplementing DHA in puppy diets diets containing 14 n3 fatty acids or 019 DHA resulted in optimal neurological function  Vitamin E Along with DHA vitamin E also supports the proper development of eyesight reduces oxidative damage and provides additional immune function support During instances of immune system stimulation such as vaccinations and infection immune cells generate more tissue damaging free radicals These free radicals are reduced by the action of antioxidants such as vitamin E which promote the formation and maintenance of healthy immune cells The adequate intake level laid out by the NRC consists of 24 mgkg 36 IUkg of vitamin E with a recommended allowance of 30 mgkg 45 IUkg However the regulatory guidance laid out by AAFCO states a vitamin E minimum recommendation of 50 IUkg DM Nonetheless these values have been shown to be insufficient for immune protection immune function is best optimized at a level of 500 IUkg In addition to prevention of free radical damage this higher level of vitamin E greatly increases the number of memory CD4 immune cells aiding in a greater and a longer response to infection Due to their stilldeveloping immune system puppies are more susceptible to infection than adult dogs and proper levels of vitamin E as indicated above are needed in their diet Fibre Although young growing dogs have immature gastrointestinal tracts they do contain microflora which can ferment fibre and generate short chain fatty acids beneficial to gut health Colonization and establishment of these bacterial populations happens over time beginning immediately after birth Even with the ability for fermentation addition of fibre to the diet should be done carefully as fibre will dilute other nutrients in the feed There are different types of fibre all are made of carbohydrates and NRC classifies them into fermentable and nonfermentable carbohydrates Fermentable carbohydrates are generally 310 monosaccharide units joined by glycosidic bonds which cannot be degraded by endogenous enzymes and require the fermentation processes of intestinal microflora for proper degradation Nonfermentable fibres are carbohydrate structures which are not fully fermented even by intestinal microflora Little research has been done on nonfermentable fibre however it is known that it causes fecal bulking and reduced intestinal transit time It has been shown that addition of nonfermentable fibre in concentrations of 22 or greater of the total diet will reduce growth feed intake and feed efficiency Fermentable fibre is more beneficial for growing puppies and it is often considered a prebiotic meaning it supports the growth of beneficial microflora species in the intestinal tract Fermentable fibre often contains fructooligosaccharides FOS and mannanoligosaccharides MOS both of which greatly stimulate gut health FOS are fermented by beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria promoting their growth while most pathogenic bacterial strains such as E coli C perfringens and Salmonella are unable to ferment it MOS has been shown to stimulate the immune system and increase resistance to pathogenic bacteria Beet pulp is generally the standard fermentable fibre used in canine diets however blends of fermentable fibre sources have been shown to be as effective at promoting gut health Although fermentable fibre is extremely beneficial it should still be added in moderate amounts as addition of fermentable fibre to a concentration of 141 or greater will result in lower digestibility of the feed Protein Growing puppies require higher levels of protein than adult dogs of the same breed to promote proper growth and development Protein should account for at least 25 of energy however protein requirements also depend on the digestibility of the protein and age of the puppy Amino acid and nitrogen requirements decrease between 1014 weeks indicating that different protein levels are often beneficial before and after 14 weeks of age Before 14 weeks of age a protein level of 250 gkg of diet 25 of the diet containing 40 kcal MEg will result in optimal growth After 14 weeks of age protein requirements decrease to 200 gkg of diet 20 of the diet for optimal growth  Protein in excess of these levels is metabolized and leads to an increase of the glomerular filtration rate and increased urea excretion in the urine with no evidence of damage to the kidneys However addition of protein past these requirements is not recommended although the NRC has not quantified a safe upper limit Considering that the energy density of protein is similar to that of carbohydrates an excess of protein in the diet may lead to fat deposition and weight gain This excess weight can lead to abnormal joint development potentially giving rise to joint issues in the future Additionally excess of some amino acids may also have detrimental impacts for example excess lysine will negatively antagonise arginine The minimal requirement laid out by the NRC is 180gkg 18 DM of crude protein with a recommended allowance of 225gkg 225 DM With this in mind it is also important to consider the quality and digestibility of the protein used Iodine To date there is little information available about minimum requirements of dietary iodine for developing puppies However literature suggests that overdosage of iodine in puppies has deleterious effects on the thyroid gland High dietary iodine may cause both hypothyroidism and changes in bone metabolism considering that thyroid hormones are key factors in osteogenesis as they stimulate osteoblasts and promote collagen synthesis and mineralization of the osteoid  This is particularly important during juvenile development as these hormones favor the action of growth hormone GH and its facilitator insulin growth factor1 IGF1 at the osteoplastic level Hypothyroidism acquired at an early age presents a delay in the maturation and development of the ossification sites of newlydeveloping bone It is therefore important to closely monitor the amount of iodine in puppy diets in order to prevent overdosage The NRC states an adequate intake and recommended allowance of 900 Œºgkg DM which translates into 220Œºg1000 kcal These values have been shown in multiple studies to be the recommended maximum allowance of iodine that would result in no abnormalities Synopsis Canine development diets are designed specifically to meet the energy demands and nutritional requirements for healthy growth Proper nutrition is imperative to support development of bones joints muscles and the immune system and includes the addition of nutrients such as protein essential fatty acids calcium fibre vitamin E and others Ensuring optimal energy intake allows the diet to meet the high energy demands of puppies while avoiding over nutrition overaccelerated growth and unhealthy weight gain Dietary fats also help to meet these high energy demands and provide the essential fatty acids necessary for brain neuron and retinal development and function Since growing puppies require greater amounts of protein than their adult counterparts it is important to include the appropriate amounts to support healthy development Correct levels of both fermentable and nonfermentable fibre help to support GI and immune health During growth young dogs are more susceptible to infection but the addition of proper levels of vitamin E to the diet reduces free radical oxidative damage and leads to an increase in immunity Calcium and phosphorus in the appropriate amounts and ratio aid in proper bone and cartilage growth and maturation It is imperative to be aware of the levels of other minerals as well as the overdosage of iodine can lead to hypothyroidism and the delay in maturation and development of bones It is therefore important to feed a diet that meets the nutrient minimum andor maximum requirements established by the National Research Council in order to ensure optimal growth and development of young dogs of all breeds See also  References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Refeeding syndrome is a syndrome consisting of metabolic disturbances that occur as a result of reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are starved severely malnourished or metabolically stressed due to severe illness When too much food andor liquid nutrition supplement is consumed during the initial four to seven days of refeeding this triggers synthesis of glycogen fat and protein in cells to the detriment of serum concentrations of potassium magnesium and phosphorus Cardiac pulmonary and neurological symptoms can be signs of refeeding syndrome The low serum minerals if severe enough can be fatal    Cause Any individual who has had negligible nutrient intake for many consecutive days andor is metabolically stressed from a critical illness or major surgery is at risk of refeeding syndrome Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to refeed Patients can develop fluid and electrolyte disorders especially hypophosphatemia along with neurologic pulmonary cardiac neuromuscular and hematologic complications During fasting the body switches its main fuel source from carbohydrates and fat to tissue fatty acids and amino acids as the main energy sources The spleen decreases its rate of red blood cell breakdown thus conserving red blood cells Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period although serum levels remain normal Importantly insulin secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and glucagon secretion is increased During refeeding insulin secretion resumes in response to increased blood sugar resulting in increased glycogen fat and protein synthesis This process requires phosphates magnesium and potassium which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular ATP and 23diphosphoglycerate in red blood cells leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the bodys organs Refeeding increases the basal metabolic rate Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the serum electrolytes including phosphorus and magnesium Levels of serum glucose may rise and the B1 vitamin thiamine may fall Cardiac arrhythmias are the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome with other significant risks including confusion coma and convulsions and cardiac failure This syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for anorexia nervosa when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be lethal It can also occur after the onset of a severe illness or major surgery The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate This can lead to acute heart failure Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult Treatment Refeeding syndrome can be fatal if not recognized and treated properly An awareness of the condition and a high index of suspicion are required in order to make the diagnosis The electrolyte disturbances of the refeeding syndrome can occur within the first few days of refeeding Close monitoring of blood biochemistry is therefore necessary in the early refeeding period In critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit if phosphate drops to below 065\\xa0mmol from a previously normal level within three days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition caloric intake should be reduced to 480 kcals per day for at least two days whilst electrolytes are replaced Prescribing thiamine vitamin B complex strong and a multivitamin and mineral preparation is recommended Biochemistry should be monitored regularly until it is stable Although clinical trials are lacking in patients other than those admitted to an intensive care it is commonly recommended that energy intake should remain lower than that normally required for the first 3‚Äì5 days of treatment of refeeding syndrome See NICE Clinical guideline CG32 section 66 On first aid and preliminary medical management see for example the guidance by HMS Monmouth medical officer History A common error repeated in multiple papers claims that The syndrome was first described after World War II in Americans who held by the Japanese as prisoners of war had become malnourished during captivity and who were then released to the care of United States personnel in the Philippines However closer inspection of the 1951 paper by Schnitker reveals the prisoners under study were not American POWs but Japanese soldiers who already malnourished surrendered in the Philippines during 1945 after the war was over It is actually quite difficult to ascertain when the syndrome was first discovered and named but it is likely the associated electrolyte disturbances were identified well before 1951 perhaps in Holland during the closing months of World War II before Victory Day in Europe See also

       "  'raw page text': 'The Reference Daily Intake or Recommended Daily Intake RDI is the daily intake level of a nutrient that is considered to be sufficient to meet the requirements of 97‚Äì98 of healthy individuals in every demographic in the United States While developed for the US population it has been adopted by other countries though not universally The RDI is used to determine the Daily Value DV of foods which is printed on nutrition facts labels as DV in the United States and Canada and is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration FDA and Health Canada respectively The Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs were a set of nutrition recommendations that evolved into both the Dietary Reference Intake DRI system of nutrition recommendations which still defines RDA values and the RDIs used for food labelling The first regulations governing US nutrition labels specified a  US RDA declaration based on the current RDA values which had been published in 1968 Later the\\xa0 US RDA was renamed the\\xa0DV and the RDA values that the\\xa0DVs were based on became the RDIs The RDAs and later the RDA values within the DRI were regularly revised to reflect the latest scientific information but although the nutrition labeling regulations were occasionally updated the existing RDI values were not changed so that until 2016 many of the DVs used on nutrition facts labels were still based on the outdated RDAs from 1968 In 2016 the Food and Drug Administration published changes to the regulations including updated RDIs and DVs based primarily on the RDAs in the current DRI    Food labeling reference tables Daily Values used by the FDA for the following macronutrients are Daily Reference Values FDA issued a Final Rule on changes to facts panel on May 27 2016 The new values were published in the Federal Register New values can be used on labels now The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28 2018 but on September 29 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1 2020 for large companies and January 1 2021 for small companies In the interim products with old or new facts panel content will be on market shelves at same time

and new adult 100 Daily Values are given in the following table along with the more recent RDAs or AIs of the Dietary Reference Intakes maximized over sex and age groups excluding women who are pregnant or lactating History The RDI is derived from the RDAs which were first developed during World War II by Lydia J Roberts Hazel Stiebeling and Helen S Mitchell all part of a committee established by the US National Academy of Sciences to investigate issues of nutrition that might affect national defense Nestle 35 The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941 after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces for civilians and for overseas population who might need food relief Roberts Stiebeling and Mitchell surveyed all available data created a tentative set of allowances for energy and eight nutrients and submitted them to experts for review Nestle 35 The final set of guidelines called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances were accepted in 1941 The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel so they included a margin of safety Because of food rationing during the war the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens nutritional intake also took food availability into account The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years In 1973 the FDA introduced regulations to specify the format of nutrition labels when present although the inclusion of such labels was largely voluntary only being required if nutrition claims were made or if nutritional supplements were added to the food The nutrition labels were to include percent US RDA based on the 1968 RDAs in effect at the time The RDAs continued to be updated in 1974 1980 and 1989 but the values specified for nutrition labelling remained unchanged In 1993 the FDA published new regulations mandating the inclusion of a nutrition facts label on most packaged foods Originally the FDA had proposed replacing the percent US RDAs with percent daily values based on the 1989 RDAs but the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 prevented it from doing so Instead it introduced the RDI to be the basis of the new daily values The RDI consisted of the existing US RDA values still based on the 1968 RDAs as the FDA was not allowed to change them at the time and new values for additional nutrients not included in the 1968 RDAs In 1997 at the suggestion of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy the RDAs became one part of a broader set of dietary guidelines called the Dietary Reference Intake used by both the United States and Canada As part of the DRI the RDAs continued to be updated On May 27 2016 the FDA updated the regulations to change the RDI and Daily Values to reflect current scientific information Until this time the Daily Values were still largely based on the 1968 RDAs The new regulations make several other changes to the nutrition facts label to facilitate consumer understanding of the calorie and nutrient contents of their foods emphasizing nutrients of current concern such as vitamin D and potassium The revision to the regulations came into effect on 26 July 2016 and initially stipulated that larger manufacturers must comply within two years while smaller manufacturers had an additional year On September 29 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1 2020 for large companies and January 1 2021 for small companies Sodium In 2010 the US Institute of Medicine determined that the government should establish new consumption standards for salt to reduce the amount of sodium in the typical American diet below levels associated with higher risk of several cardiovascular diseases yet maintain consumer preferences for saltflavored food The daily maximum for

       "  'raw page text': 'Salt consumption has been intensely studied for its role in human physiology and impact on human health In particular excessive dietary salt consumption over an extended period of time has been associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease in addition to other adverse health effects Common edible salt is composed of sodium chloride    Effect of salt on blood pressure  The human body has evolved to balance salt intake with need through means such as the reninangiotensin system In humans salt has important biological functions Relevant to risk of cardiovascular disease salt is highly involved with the maintenance of body fluid volume including osmotic balance in the blood extracellular and intracellular fluids and resting membrane potential The well known effect of sodium on blood pressure can be explained by comparing blood to a solution with its salinity changed by ingested salt Artery walls are analogous to a selectively permeable membrane and they allow solutes including sodium and chloride to pass through or not depending on osmosis Circulating water and solutes in the body maintain blood pressure in the blood as well as other functions such as regulation of body temperature When salt is ingested it is dissolved in the blood as two separate ions  Na and Cl‚àí The water potential in blood will decrease due to the increase solutes and blood osmotic pressure will increase While the kidney reacts to excrete excess sodium and chloride in the body water retention causes blood pressure to increase DASHSodium study  The DASHSodium study was a sequel to the original DASH Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension study Both studies were designed and conducted by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in the United States each involving a large randomized sample While the original study was designed to test the effects of several varying nutrients on blood pressure DASHSodium varies only in salt content in the diet Participants were prehypertensive or at stage 1 hypertension and either ate a DASHDiet or a diet reflecting an average American Diet During the intervention phase participants ate their assigned diets containing three distinct levels of sodium in random order Their blood pressure is monitored during the control period and at all three intervention phases The study concluded that the effect of a reduced dietary sodium intake alone on blood pressure is substantial and that the largest decrease in blood pressure occurred in those eating the DASH eating plan at the lowest sodium level 1500 milligrams per day However this study is especially significant because participants in both the control and DASH diet group showed lowered blood pressure with decreased sodium alone In agreement with studies regarding salt sensitivity participants of African descent showed high reductions in blood pressure See sodium sensitivity below Hypertension and cardiovascular disease There has been strong evidence from epidemiological studies human and animal intervention experiments supporting the links between high rate of salt intake and hypertension A Cochrane review and metaanalysis of clinical trials showed that reduced sodium intake reduces blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive subjects Since controlling hypertension is related to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease it is plausible that salt consumption is a risk factor for cardiovascular health However to properly study the effects of sodium intake levels on risk of development of cardiovascular disease longterm studies of large groups using both dietary and biochemical measures are necessary Several of these studies show that groups with sodiumreduced diets have lower incidences of cardiovascular disease in all demographics and in particular lower blood pressure One study showed lower incidence of cardiovascular disease after 15 years of sodium reduction in a randomised trial More data is needed to support the conclusions of observational studies which suffer from design flaws Many of these studies are not large enough nor last long enough to provide conclusions on clinical outcomes for the effect of dietary sodium intake on morbidity and mortality Previous mixed results and inconclusive interpretation of nonexperimental studies may also root from the way sodium is measured in the study The study by Cook and colleagues itself was unable to isolate only a change in sodium The techniques to reduce sodium included keeping a food diary and reading labels Cook and colleagues listed other effects of those techniques including a reduction in fat and calories per day 11g 200cal and weight loss of 1 to 3 pounds A 2014 Cochrane review found evidence that salt reduction prevented cardiovascular disease but that the magnitude of the effect was uncertain and larger than would be predicted from the small blood pressure reductions achieved Current trends and campaigns The World Health Organization issued a 2014 fact sheet to encourage reducing global salt consumption by 30 through 2025 In 2015 the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began an initiative encouraging Americans to reduce their consumption of salty foods The American Heart Association defined a daily sodium consumption limit should be 1500 milligrams contained in less than 075 teaspoon of table salt According to a 2012 Health Canada report Canadians in all age groups are consuming 3400\\xa0mg per day of sodium more than twice as much as needed The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that the average daily sodium intake for Americans over 2 years of age is 3436\\xa0milligrams The majority of sodium consumed by North Americans is from processed and restaurant foods while only a small portion is added during cooking or at the table In the European Union half of the member states legislated change in the form of taxation mandatory nutrition labeling and regulated nutrition and health claims to address overconsumption of sodium in response to a 2012 EU Salt Reduction Framework Debate about sodium as a health problem Despite few claims to the contrary most physicians and clinical scientists the European Food Safety Authority and the US Centers for Disease Control recommend that consumers use less salt in their diets mainly to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and associated cardiovascular diseases in adults and children A limited group of researchers has cast doubts on the generally accepted theory that lowering sodium intake will improve the health of a given population  Rather than create drastic salt policies based on conflicting data Alderman and his colleague Hillel Cohen propose that the government sponsor a large controlled clinical trial to see what happens to people who follow lowsalt diets over time Appel responds that such a trial cannot and will not be done in part because it would be so expensive But unless we have clear data evangelical antisalt campaigns are not just based on shaky science they are ultimately unfair A great number of promises are being made to the public with regard to this enormous benefit and lives saved Cohen says But it is based on wild extrapolations   Taken together our current findings refute the estimates of computer models of lives saved and health care costs reduced with lower salt intake They do also not support the current recommendations of a generalized and indiscriminate reduction of salt intake at the population level However they do not negate the blood pressurelowering effects of a dietary salt reduction in hypertensive patients  The traditional Japanese diet is very high in salt intake and yet the Japanese had the highest rate of longevity in the world and low rates of cardiovascular disease   we have found that the Japanese dietary pattern is associated with lower CVD mortality despite the fact that the Japanese dietary pattern appeared to be related to higher sodium intake and high prevalence of hypertension Other adverse cardiovascular effects Some studies have shown that salt consumption has been found to increase the risk of myocardial infarction stroke arterial stiffness and heart failure Effects of low salt consumption In the majority of studies reducing sodium intake lowers the risk of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disorders In a few studies both high more than 7 gday and low salt intake less than 3 gday were associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and increased mortality Sodium sensitivity A diet high in sodium increases the risk of hypertension in people with sodium sensitivity corresponding to an increase in health risks associated with hypertensions including cardiovascular disease Unfortunately there is no universal definition of sodium sensitivity the method to assess sodium sensitivity varies from one study to another In most studies sodium sensitivity is defined as the change in mean blood pressure corresponding to a decrease or increase of sodium intake The method to assess sodium sensitivity includes the measurement of circulating fluid volume and peripheral vascular resistance Several studies have shown a relationship between sodium sensitivity and the increase of circulating fluid volume or peripheral vascular resistance A number of factors have been found to be associated with sodium sensitivity Demographic factors which affect sodium sensitivity include race gender and age One study shows that the American population of African descent are significantly more salt sensitive than Caucasians Women are found to be more sodium sensitive than men one possible explanation is based on the fact that women have a tendency to consume more salt per unit weight as women weigh less than men on average Several studies have shown that the increase in age is also associated with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity The difference in genetic makeup and family history has a significant impact on salt sensitivity and is being studied more with improvement on the efficiencies and techniques of genetic testing In both hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals those with haptoglobin 11 phenotype are more likely to have sodium sensitivity than people with haptoglobin 21 or 22 phenotypes More specifically haptoglobin 22 phenotypes contribute to the characteristic of sodiumresistance in humans Moreover prevalence of a family history of hypertension is strongly linked with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity The influence of physiological factors including renal function and insulin levels on sodium sensitivity are shown in various studies One study concludes that the effect of renal failure on sodium sensitivity is substantial due to the contribution of decreasing the Glomerular filtration rate GFR in the kidney Moreover insulin resistance is found to be related to sodium sensitivity however the actual mechanism is still unknown Potassium and hypertension  Possible mechanisms by which high intakes of dietary potassium can decrease risk of hypertension and instances of cardiovascular disease have been proposed but not extensively studied However studies have found a strong inverse association between longterm adequate to high rates of potassium intake and the development of cardiovascular diseases The recommended dietary intake of potassium is higher than that of sodium Unfortunately the average absolute intake of potassium of studied populations is lower than that of sodium intake According to Statistics Canada Canadians potassium intake in all age groups are lower than recommended while sodium intake greatly exceed recommended intake in every age group It has been hypothesized that the ratio of potassium to sodium intake accounts for the large difference in the occurrence of hypertension between primitive cultures eating diets made up of mostly unprocessed foods and Western diets which tend to include highly processed foods Salt substitutes  The growing awareness of excessive sodium consumption in connection with hypertension and cardiovascular disease has increased the usage of salt substitutes at both a consumer and industrial level On a consumer level salt substitutes which usually substitute a portion of sodium chloride content with potassium chloride can be used to increase the potassium to sodium consumption ratio This change has been shown to blunt the effects of excess salt intake on hypertension and cardiovascular disease It has also been suggested that salt substitutes can be used to provide an essential portion of daily potassium intake and may even be more economical than prescription potassium supplements In the food industry processes have been developed to create lowsodium versions of existing products The meat industry especially have developed and finetuned methods to decrease salt contents in processed meats without sacrificing consumer acceptance Research demonstrates that salt substitutes such as potassium chloride and synergistic compounds such as phosphates can be used to decrease salt content in meat products There have been concerns with certain populations use of potassium chloride as a substitute for salt as high potassium loads are dangerous for groups with diabetes renal diseases or heart failure The use of salts with minerals such as natural salts have also been tested but like salt substitutes partially containing potassium mineral salts produce a bitter taste above certain levels See also Salt Hypertension Cardiovascular Disease References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly single bonds A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules glycerol and fatty acids Fats are made of long chains of carbon C atoms Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds CC and others are linked by double bonds CC Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds They are called saturated because the second bond is broken up and each half of the bond is attached to saturated with a hydrogen atom Most animal fats are saturated The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated Saturated fats tend to have higher melting points than their corresponding unsaturated fats leading to the popular understanding that saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperatures while unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature with varying degrees of viscosity meaning both saturated and unsaturated fats are found to be liquid at body temperature Various fats contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat Examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat include animal fat products such as cream cheese butter other whole milk dairy products and fatty meats which also contain dietary cholesterol Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil Many prepared foods are high in saturated fat content such as pizza dairy desserts and sausage The effect of saturated fat on risk of disease is controversial Many reviews recommend a diet low in saturated fat and argue it will lower risks of cardiovascular diseases diabetes or death However other reviews have challenged those arguments or advocated for examining the proportion of saturated to unsaturated fat in the diet  Fat profiles While nutrition labels regularly combine them the saturated fatty acids appear in different proportions among food groups Lauric and myristic acids are most commonly found in tropical oils eg palm kernel coconut and dairy products The saturated fat in meat eggs cacao and nuts is primarily the triglycerides of palmitic and stearic acids Examples of saturated fatty acids  Some common examples of fatty acids Butyric acid with 4 carbon atoms contained in butter Lauric acid with 12 carbon atoms contained in coconut oil palm kernel oil and breast milk Myristic acid with 14 carbon atoms contained in cows milk and dairy products Palmitic acid with 16 carbon atoms contained in palm oil and meat Stearic acid with 18 carbon atoms also contained in meat and cocoa butter   Association with diseases Since the 1950s it has been demonstrated that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids including meat fats milk fat butter lard coconut oil palm oil and palm kernel oil is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil peanut oil canola oil avocados corn sunflower soy and cottonseed oils Cardiovascular disease  The effect of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease is controversial Many health authorities such as the American Dietetic Association the British Dietetic Association American Heart Association the World Heart Federation the British National Health Service among others advise that saturated fat is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease The World Health Organization in May 2015 recommends switching from saturated to unsaturated fats A number of systematic reviews have examined the relationship between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease and have come to different conclusions A 2017 systematic review by the American Heart Association of randomized controlled clinical trials showed that reducing intake of dietary saturated fat and replacing it with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats could reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment for maintaining blood cholesterol within normal limits A different 2017 systematic review of controlled randomized controlled trials concluded that replacing saturated fats with mostly n6 polyunsaturated fats is unlikely to reduce coronary heart disease CHD events CHD mortality or total mortality The 2017 review showed that inadequately controlled trials eg failing to control for other lifestyle factors that were included in earlier metaanalyses explain the prior results A 2015 systematic review also found no association between saturated fat consumption and risk of heart disease stroke diabetes or death A 2014 systematic review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids observational studies of measured fatty acid levels in the blood and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation concluded that the findings ‚Ä≥do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of longchain omega3 and omega6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids‚Ä≥ Researchers acknowledged that despite their results further research is necessary especially in people who are initially healthy Due to potential weaknesses in this review experts recommend people remain with the current guidelines to reduce saturated fat consumption The American Heart Association noted that these cohort studies unlike clinical trials have more difficulty controlling for the consumption of carbohydrates as a replacement macronutrient for those who consumed less saturated fat While many studies have found that including polyunsaturated fats in the diet in place of saturated fats produces more beneficial CVD outcomes the effects of substituting monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates are unclear Dyslipidemia  The consumption of saturated fat is generally considered a risk factor for dyslipidemia which in turn is a risk factor for some types of cardiovascular disease There are strong consistent and graded relationships between saturated fat intake blood cholesterol levels and the mass occurrence of cardiovascular disease The relationships are accepted as causal Abnormal blood lipid levels that is high total cholesterol high levels of triglycerides high levels of lowdensity lipoprotein LDL bad cholesterol or low levels of highdensity lipoprotein HDL good cholesterol cholesterol are all associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke Metaanalyses have found a significant relationship between saturated fat and serum cholesterol levels High total cholesterol levels which may be caused by many factors are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease However other indicators measuring cholesterol such as high totalHDL cholesterol ratio are more predictive than total serum cholesterol In a study of myocardial infarction in 52 countries the ApoBApoA1 related to LDL and HDL respectively ratio was the strongest predictor of CVD among all risk factors There are other pathways involving obesity triglyceride levels insulin sensitivity endothelial function and thrombogenicity among others that play a role in CVD although it seems in the absence of an adverse blood lipid profile the other known risk factors have only a weak atherogenic effect Different saturated fatty acids have differing effects on various lipid levels Cancer Breast cancer  A metaanalysis published in 2003 found a significant positive relationship in both control and cohort studies between saturated fat and breast cancer However two subsequent reviews have found weak or insignificant associations of saturated fat intake and breast cancer risk and note the prevalence of confounding factors Colorectal cancer One review found limited evidence for a positive relationship between consuming animal fat and incidence of colorectal cancer Ovarian cancer A metaanalysis of eight observational studies published in 2001 found a statistically significant positive relationship between saturated fat and ovarian cancer However a 2013 study found that a pooled analysis of 12 cohort studies observed no association between total fat intake and ovarian cancer risk Further analysis revealed that omega3 fatty acids were protective against ovarian cancer and that trans fats were a risk factor This study revealed that histological subtypes should be examined in determining the impact of dietary fat on ovarian cancer rather than an oversimplified focus on total fat intake Prostate cancer  Some researchers have indicated that serum myristic acid and palmitic acid and dietary myristic and palmitic saturated fatty acids and serum palmitic combined with alphatocopherol supplementation are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in a dosedependent manner These associations may however reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls rather than being an actual cause Bones Mounting evidence indicates that the amount and type of fat in the diet can have important effects on bone health Most of this evidence is derived from animal studies The data from one study indicated that bone mineral density is negatively associated with saturated fat intake and that men may be particularly vulnerable Dietary recommendations Recommendations to reduce or limit dietary intake of saturated fats are made by the World Health Organization American Heart Association Health Canada the US Department of Health and Human Services the UK Food Standards Agency the Australian Department of Health and Aging the Singapore Government Health Promotion Board the Indian Government Citizens Health Portal the New Zealand Ministry of Health the Food and Drugs Board Ghana the Republic of Guyana Ministry of Health and Hong Kongs Centre for Food Safety In 2003 the World Health Organization WHO and Food and Agriculture Organization FAO expert consultation report concluded that intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related to cardiovascular risk The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10 of daily energy intake and less than 7 for highrisk groups If populations are consuming less than 10 they should not increase that level of intake Within these limits intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids In developing countries however where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low BMI lt185 kgm2 The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements Specific sources of saturated fat such as coconut and palm oil provide lowcost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor A 2004 statement released by the Centers for Disease Control CDC determined that Americans need to continue working to reduce saturated fat intake‚Ä¶ In addition reviews by the American Heart Association led the Association to recommend reducing saturated fat intake to less than 7 of total calories according to its 2006 recommendations This concurs with similar conclusions made by the US Department of Health and Human Services which determined that reduction in saturated fat consumption would positively affect health and reduce the prevalence of heart disease The United Kingdom National Health Service claims the majority of UK people eat too much saturated fat The British Heart Foundation also advises people to cut down on saturated fat People are advised to cut down on saturated fat and read labels on food they buy A 2004 review stated that no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies Blanket recommendations to lower saturated fat were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the American Dietetic Association for focusing too narrowly on reducing saturated fats rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates Concern was expressed over the health risks of replacing saturated fats in the diet with refined carbohydrates which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease particularly at the expense of polyunsaturated fats which may have health benefits None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption of saturated fats emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health In a 2017 comprehensive review of the literature and clinical trials the American Heart Association published a recommendation that saturated fat intake be reduced or replaced by products containing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats a dietary adjustment that could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 30 Molecular description   It should be noted as this is the defining factor of saturated fats that the twodimensional illustration has implicit hydrogen atoms bonded to each of the carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the myristic acid molecule there are 13 carbon atoms in the tail 14 carbon atoms in the entire molecule Carbon atoms are also implicitly drawn as they are portrayed as intersections between two straight lines Saturated in general refers to a maximum number of hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon of the polycarbon tail as allowed by the Octet Rule This also means that only single bonds sigma bonds will be present between adjacent carbon atoms of the tail  See also  References  Further reading',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Most medical scientific hearthealth governmental and professional authorities agree that saturated fat is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease including the World Health Organization the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Medicine the American Dietetic Association the Dietitians of Canada the British Dietetic Association American Heart Association the British Heart Foundation the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada the World Heart Federation the British National Health Service the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority All of these organizations recommend restricting consumption of saturated fats to reduce that risk However some metaanalyses of clinical trials and cohort studies have provided evidence against the recommendation for reduced intake of saturated fat and some health journalists scientists and one trade association continue to reject the recommendation to reduce consumption of saturated fat  History Cholesterol and cardiovascular disease The initial connection between arteriosclerosis and dietary cholesterol was made by the Russian pathologist Nikolay Anichkov prior to World War I Another significant contribution to the debate was made by the Dutch physician internist Cornelis de Langen who noticed the correlation between nutritional cholesterol intake and incidence of gallstones and soon after arteriosclerosis and other Western diseases in the Javanese population in 1916 De Langen reported on his findings at the conference of the International Society of Geographic Pathology in 1935 These observations were made on patients admitted to the municipal hospital in Jakarta Consequently he studied this phenomenon in defined populations outside the hospital He showed that the traditional Javanese diet very poor in cholesterol and other lipids was associated with a low level of blood cholesterol as well as a low incidence of cardiovascular disease CVD while the prevalence of CVD in Europeans in Java living on the Western diet was significantly higher De Langens colleague Isidor Snapper made a similar observation in North China in 1940 Since de Langen published his results only in Dutch his work remained unknown to most of the international scientific community Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease The hypothesis that saturated fat has a detrimental effect on human health gained prominence in the 1950s as a result of the work of Ancel Keys a US nutritional scientist At that time in the USA the incidence of heart disease was rapidly increasing for reasons that were not clear Keys postulated a correlation between circulating cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease and initiated a study of Minnesota businessmen the first prospective study of CVD Keys presented his dietlipidheart disease hypothesis at a 1955 expert meeting of the World Health Organization in Geneva In response to criticism at the conference he set out to conduct the yearslong Seven Countries Study Ancel Keys joined the nutrition committee of the American Heart Association and successfully promulgated his idea such that in 1961 with the result that the AHA became the first group anywhere in the world to advise cutting back on saturated fat and dietary cholesterol to prevent heart disease This historic recommendation was reported on the cover of Time Magazine in that same year Systematic reviews Summary table of data Review details A 2017 systematic review focusing on adequately controlled randomized controlled trials concluded that replacing saturated fats with mostly n6 polyunsaturated fats is unlikely to reduce coronary heart disease CHD events CHD mortality or total mortality The 2017 review showed that inadequately controlled trials eg failing to control for other lifestyle factors that were included in earlier metaanalyses explain the prior results A 2017 systematic review by the American Heart Association recommended that decreasing saturated fat intake and increasing consumption of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats could lower risk of cardiovascular disease by about 30 A 2015 systematic review also found no association between saturated fat consumption and risk of heart disease stroke diabetes or death A 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the Cochrane Library found that reducing saturated fat intake resulted in a 17 reduction in cardiovascular events and that replacing saturated fats with cis unsaturated fats in particular is beneficial It concluded Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats  In 2014 a systematic review and metaanalysis of 72 published studies totaling 530525 participants looked at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids observational studies of measured fatty acid levels in the blood and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation The authors of the review concluded that ‚Ä≥Current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats‚Ä≥ A 2014 systematic review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids observational studies of measured fatty acid levels in the blood and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation concluded that the findings ‚Ä≥do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of longchain omega3 and omega6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids‚Ä≥ Researchers acknowledged that despite their results further research is necessary especially in people who are initially healthy Until the picture becomes clearer experts recommend people stick to the current guidelines on fat consumption Indeed Nita Forouhi one of the coauthors of the metaanalysis stated to the BBC that headlines proclaiming that butter is back are an oversimplification we never said that and noted that the study was not able to distinguish between the differing effects of reducing saturated fat intake depending on what foods were used in substitute While that research is going on I dont think we should just go changing everything Its too premature to give the public the impression that they have a licence based on this preliminary research which is exciting but not yet definitive to say butter is back Moreover Walter Willett warned that the conclusions of the metaanalysis are seriously misleading contains major errors and omissions and should be retracted In response to the Chowdhury review Willett et al commented that  ‚Ä≥The metaanalysis of dietary fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease by Chowdhury et al contains multiple errors and omissions and the conclusions are seriously misleading particularly the lack of association with N6 polyunsaturated fat For example two of the six studies included in the analysis of N6 polyunsaturated fat were wrong The relative risks for Nurses‚Äô Health Study NHS and Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Study KIHD were retrieved incorrectly and said to be above 10 However in the 20year followup of the NHS the relative risk for highest vs lowest quintile was 077 95 percent CI 062 095 ptrend  001 the authors seem to have used the RR for N3 alphalinolenic acid from a paper on sudden cardiac death and in the KIHD the relative risk was 039 95 confidence interval CI 021071 the origin of the number used in the metaanalysis is unclear Also relevant data from other studies were not included   Further the authors did not mention a pooled analysis of the primary data from prospective studies in which a significant inverse association between intake of polyunsaturated fat the large majority being the N6 linoleic acid and risk of CHD was found Also in this analysis substitution of polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat was associated with lower risk of CHD Chowdhury et al also failed to point out that most of the monounsaturated fat consumed in their studies was from red meat and dairy sources and the findings do not necessarily apply to consumption in the form of nuts olive oil and other plant sources Thus the conclusions of Chowdhury et al regarding the type of fat being unimportant are seriously misleading and should be disregarded‚Ä≥  Views Mainstream opinion Specialistprofessional textbooks The 2009 European Society of Cardiology Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine states that in cohort studies the positive relationship between fat intake and CVDs was linked to their saturated fatty acid content 2007s Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation states that large epidemiological studies have shown consistent associations between the intake of saturated fatty acids and CHD mortality According to the 2007 Critical Pathways in Cardiovascular Medicine substituting unsaturated fat for saturated fat may lower LDL cholesterol without simultaneously lowering HDL cholesterol This dietary principle partly underlies the Mediterranean style of diet which has been associated with reduced cardiovascular event rates in two randomized controlled trials The 2003 second edition of Evidencebased Cardiology in PartII Prevention of cardiovascular diseases recommends a low intake of SFA less than 7 of daily calories and intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be especially reduced The recommendation was evaluated to be supported by the best grade of available evidence Position statements and guidelines of major health organizations Medical establishments In 2003 a World Health Organization WHO and Food and Agricultural Organization FAO expert consultation report concluded that intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related to cardiovascular risk The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10 of daily energy intake and less than 7 for highrisk groups If populations are consuming less than 10 they should not increase that level of intake Within these limits intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids In developing countries however where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low BMI lt185 kgm2 The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements Specific sources of saturated fat such as coconut and palm oil provide lowcost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor In its 2007 guidelines the European Society of Cardiology states that there are strong consistent and graded relationships between saturated fat intake blood cholesterol levels and the mass occurrence of cardiovascular disease The relationships are accepted as causal The Mayo Clinic considers saturated fats potentially harmful and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats potentially helpful It references the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 and recommends reducing foods rich in saturated fat and emphasizing options with more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats The British Dietetic Association guidelines found good evidence in systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that reducing saturated fat reduces morbidity in patients with CVD The 2007 position statement of the American Dietetic Association and the Dieticians of Canada holds that epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between the intake of saturated fatty acid and the incidence of coronary heart disease The Harvard School of Public Health holds that saturated fats should be replaced with cis monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats but that they should not be replaced with refined carbohydrates Hearthealth organizations The Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation assesses that consumption of saturated fat raises LDL levels which are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease Similar positions are held by the American Heart Association the British Heart Foundation the National Heart Foundation of Australia the National Heart Foundation of New Zealand and the World Heart Federation The Irish Heart Foundation states that saturated fats can raise LDL cholesterol and increase the chance of developing heart disease or stroke Governmental guidelines The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 produced by the US Department of Agriculture USDA and US Department of Health and Human Services says the human body makes more than enough saturated fats to meet its needs and does not require more from dietary sources It says higher levels of saturated fats are associated with higher levels of total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein bad cholesterol and recommends reduced saturated fat intake The guidelines are based on the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee DGAC report that incorporated the results of the review of 12 studies from 2004 to 2009 conducted by the Nutrition Evidence Library NEL part of the Evidence Analysis Library Division of the USDAs Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion The NEL concluded that there was strong evidence that dietary saturated fats increased serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease Editorial commentary and conference findings A 2010 debate at the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticss 93rd conference stated Regarding saturated fat the key point agreed upon by the panel and scientific community at large was that researchers agree that replacing saturated fat with healthy polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health and cardiovascular disease Recommendations for dieticians emphasized using mono and polyunsaturated fats whenever possible avoiding trans fats Further The evidence against saturated fat may not be as strong as dietary guidelines have interpreted it is clear that PUFAs especially and MUFAs are healthy fats and that while there is room for saturated fats within the diet but they should not be viewed as good for you A 2010 review found that the risk of coronary heart disease is reduced when saturated fatty acids are replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids but there was no clear benefit in replacing saturated fatty acids with carbohydrates or monounsaturated fatty acids A 2009 review found that the best evidence showed reduced intake of saturated fat decreased the risk for coronary heart disease Another 2009 review found that epidemiological evidence suggested a negative influence on vascular function from saturated fat but that the experimental evidence did not support this convincingly Opinion contradictory to the mainstream A opinion critique of dietary guidelines which recommended lower intake of saturated fat summarized systematic reviews and metaanalyses that found insignificant effects on the incidence of cardiovascular diseases by reducing intake of saturated fat The critique itself drew criticism and consequently was twice corrected A 2009 scientific conference reported that despite the contribution of dairy products to the saturated fatty acid intake of the diet there was no clear evidence that dairy food consumption is consistently associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease The 2010 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee report was criticized for the use of an incomplete body of relevant science inaccurately representing interpreting or summarizing the literature and drawing conclusions andor making recommendations that do not reflect the limitations or controversies in the science stating rather that the evidence associating dietary saturated fat with increased risk of cardiovascular disease is inconclusive A 2010 metaanalysis concluded that no evidence exists that dietary saturated fat is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases but this conclusion was disputed and the authors of the metaanalysis themselves later noted that A critical question is what macronutrient should be used to replace saturated fat  Epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials have provided consistent evidence that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat but not carbohydrates is beneficial for coronary heart disease See also Diet and heart disease Fast food French paradox Healthy diet Junk food Lipid hypothesis Lowcarbohydrate diet References',\n",

reductase Seleniumcontaining proteins are produced from inorganic selenium via the intermediacy of selenophosphate PSeO33‚àí    Secontaining biomolecules Selenium is an essential micronutrient in mammals but is also recognized as toxic in excess Selenium exerts its biological functions through selenoproteins which contain the amino acid selenocysteine Twentyfive selenoproteins are encoded in

locoweeds princes plume Stanleya sp woody asters Xylorhiza sp and false goldenweed Oonopsis sp Medical use of synthetic selenium compounds The substance loosely called selenium sulfide with the approximate formula SeS2 is the active ingredient in some antidandruff shampoos The selenium compound kills the scalp fungus Malassezia which causes shedding of dry skin fragments The ingredient is also used in body lotions to treat Tinea versicolor due to infection by a different species of Malassezia fungus Detection in biological fluids Selenium may be measured in blood plasma serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in a forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates selenosugars in the body prior to being eliminated in the urine Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations Toxicity Although selenium is an essential trace element it is toxic if taken in excess Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis This 400 microgram ¬µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992 The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day 15 micrograms per kilogram body weight but suggested 400 micrograms per day to not only avoid toxicity but also to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to account for data from other countries In China people who ingested corn grown in extremely seleniumrich stony coal carbonaceous shale have suffered from selenium toxicity This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 91 the highest concentration in coal ever recorded in literature Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath gastrointestinal disorders hair loss sloughing of nails fatigue irritability and neurological damage Extreme cases of selenosis can result in cirrhosis of the liver pulmonary edema and death Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of their low bioavailability By contrast selenates and selenites are very toxic having an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day for a long time Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic corrosive gas Selenium also occurs in organic compounds such as dimethyl selenide selenomethionine selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses Selenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry undeveloped lands This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds such as selenates into the water which may then be concentrated in new wetlands as the water evaporates High selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds  In fish and other wildlife low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity For example in salmon the optimal concentration of selenium in the fish tissue whole body is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of tissue dry weight At levels much below that concentration young salmon die from selenium deficiency much above that level they die from toxic excess Deficiency  Selenium deficiency is rare in healthy wellnourished individuals It can occur in patients with severely compromised intestinal function those undergoing total parenteral nutrition and in those of advanced age over 90 Also people dependent on food grown from seleniumdeficient soil are at risk Although New Zealand has low levels of selenium in its soil adverse health effects have not been detected Selenium deficiency as defined by low lt60 of normal selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues only occurs when a low selenium status is linked with an additional stress such as high exposures to mercury or as a result of increased oxidant stress due to vitamin E deficiency Selenium interacts other nutrients such as iodide and vitamin E The interaction is observed in the etiology of many deficiency diseases in animals and pure selenium deficiency is rare The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain particularly in relation to KashinBeck disease Dietary recommendations The US Institute of Medicine IOM updated Estimated Average Requirements EARs and Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs for selenium in 2000 If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs an estimate designated Adequate Intake AI is used instead The current EAR for selenium for people ages 14 and up is 45 Œºgday The RDA is 55 Œºgday RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements RDA for pregnancy is 60 Œºgday RDA for lactation is 70 Œºgday For children ages 1‚Äì13 years the RDA increases with age from 20 to 40 Œºgday As for safety the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels ULs for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient In the case of selenium the UL is 400 Œºgday Collectively the EARs RDAs AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes DRIs The European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values with Population Reference Intake PRI instead of RDA and Average Requirement instead of EAR AI and UL defined the same as in United States For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at 70 Œºgday AI for pregnancy is 70 Œºgday for lactation 85 Œºgday For children ages 1‚Äì14 years the AIs increase with age from 15 to 55 Œºgday These AIs are higher than the US RDAs The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 300 Œºgday which is lower than the US value For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value DV For selenium labeling purposes 100 of the Daily Value was 70 Œºg but as of May 27 2016 it was revised to 55 Œºg A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake Food and supplement companies have until January 1 2020 to comply with the change In the United States selenium deficiency is not common A federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19 average consumption from foods and beverages was 89 and 125 Œºgday respectively For women and men of all ages fewer than 3 consumed less than the EAR Food sources Dietary selenium comes from nuts cereals meat mushrooms fish and eggs Brazil nuts are the richest ordinary dietary source and could cause selenium toxicity if consumed regularly ‚Äì though the actual concentration of selenium as with any plantbased food sources such as another seleniumaccumulating paradise nut Lecythis belonging to the same family Lecythidaceae is soildependent and may vary significantly by geographic location In descending order of concentration high levels are also found in kidney tuna crab and lobster The human bodys content of selenium is believed to be in the 13‚Äì20 milligram range Human health Cancer Although an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer was found in some observational studies this cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation and these results should be interpreted with caution Conflicting results including inverse null and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types RCTs assessing the effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results To date no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans HIVAIDS AIDS appears to involve a slow and progressive decline in levels of selenium in the body Whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of HIV or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by AIDS patients remains debated Observational studies have found an association between decreased selenium levels and poorer outcomes in patients with HIV though these studies were mostly done prior to the currently effective treatments with highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART Currently there is inadequate evidence to recommend routine selenium supplementation for HIV patients and further research is recommended Mortality Selenium supplementation has no effect on overall mortality Tuberculosis As with other types of supplementation there is no good evidence selenium supplementation helps in the treatment of tuberculosis Diabetes A metaanalysis of four RCTs concluded that there is no support for selenium supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Caucasians Human reproductive system Abnormally high or low levels of dietary selenium can have an adverse effect on sperm quality with a consequent lowering of fertility Evolution in biology and biosynthetic considerations Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria archaea and eukaryotes as selenocysteine where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage Selenoprotein families of GSHPx and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial phylogenetic origin The selenocysteinecontaining form occurs in species as diverse as green algae diatoms sea urchin fish and chicken Selenium enzymes are involved in utilization of the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin Trace elements involved in GSHPx and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities ie selenium vanadium magnesium copper and zinc may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineraldeficient areas Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their selenoproteomes whereas the selenoproteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost These findings suggest that aquatic life supports selenium utilization whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine From about 500 Mya freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of new endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid Vitamin C polyphenols including flavonoids tocopherols etc A few of these appeared more recently in the last 50‚Äì200 million years in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants In fact the angiosperms the dominant type of plant today and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late Jurassic period About 200 Mya new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSHPx

       "  'raw page text': 'Specific appetite also known as specific hunger is a drive to eat foods with specific flavors or other characteristics Regulation of homeostasis is essential to the survival of animals Because the nutritional content of a diet will vary with environmental and other conditions it is useful for animals to have a mechanism to ensure that their nutritional needs are within the appropriate range Specific appetite is one such mechanism Specific appetite has been demonstrated in various species for a number of vitamins and minerals as well as calories protein and water Unfortunately specific appetite is very difficult to study experimentally as there are a number of factors that influence food choice Very little is known about the specific mechanisms inducing specific appetite and the genes encoding for specific appetites are mostly speculative Very few specific appetites for particular nutrients have been identified in humans The most robustly identified are salt appetitesodium appetite The problem with many other nutrients is that they do not have distinctly identifiable tastes and only two other specific appetites for iron and calcium have been identified with experimental rigour so far Other appetites are thus currently classified as learned appetites which are not innate appetites that are triggered automatically in the absence of certain nutrients but learned behaviours aversions to or preferences for certain foods as they become associated with experiences of malnutrition and illness    Learned appetite If a food source has an identifiable flavor an animal can learn to associate the positive effects of alleviation of a certain nutrient deficiency with consumption of that food This has been demonstrated in a variety of species lambs offered free choice of various foods will compensate for phosphorus sodium and calcium deficiencies Domestic fowl have demonstrated specific appetites for calcium zinc and phosphorus thiamine protein in general and methionine and lysine Heatstressed fowls seek out vitamin C which alleviates the consequences of heat stress  Learned specific appetites are not necessarily a result of an animals ability to detect the presence of a nutrient Because nutrient deficiencies of various types can have stressful effects which vary depending on the missing nutrient subsequent ingestion of that nutrient is associated with relief of certain signs An animal may therefore associate the flavor of a food that is high in a certain nutrient with relief of the signs of that nutrient deficiency while not seeking out other foods rich in the same nutrient Unlearned appetite An unlearned appetite is one that an animal possesses at birth without conditioning through prior stress followed by alleviation with specific foods An unlearned appetite suggests a physiological mechanism for detecting the absence of a nutrient as well as a signalling component that directs the animal to seek out the missing nutrient An example of an unlearned appetite might be caloric appetite as seen in all domestic animals Other unlearned appetites are more difficult to demonstrate In one study proteindeficient rats that had not previously experienced protein deficiency demonstrated strong preferences for highprotein foods such as soybean gluten and ovalbumin within thirty minutes of food presentation This preference was not seen in controls and was also exhibited by pregnant females with higher protein needs who were not experimentally proteindeficient Rats also seem to have an unlearned appetite for calcium and sodium In addition zincdepleted chicks show preferences for zincrich feeds Indirect manipulation of specific appetite Specific appetite can be indirectly induced under experimental circumstances In one study normal sodiumreplete rats exposed to angiotensin II via infusion directly into the brain developed a strong sodium appetite which persisted for months However the conclusions of this experiment have been contested Nicotine implants in rats have been shown to induce a specific appetite for sucrose even after removal of the implants Specific appetite in humans There is very little strong evidence for specific appetite in humans However it has been demonstrated that humans have the ability to taste calcium and indirect evidence supports the idea that patients on kidney dialysis who develop hypocalcemia prefer cheese with greater amounts of calcium added Exercise also increases the preference for salt Addison‚Äôs disease is known to induce a specific craving for sodium although other diseases causing hyponatremia may not induce the same response Extreme sodium depletion in human volunteers has been demonstrated to increase the desire for highsalt foods Ongoing research While the most common nutritional disorders in humans concern excessive intake of calories malnutrition remains a problem For example the link between insufficient dietary calcium and bone disorders is well established  Commonly people have an appetite for meat or eggs high protein foods But these may be expensive or otherwise unavailable A specific appetite for protein may be unsatisfied with the ingestion of a diet deficient in protein But protein is vitally important to maintaining the structures of the body‚Äôs systems so the specific appetite leads to more eating in a desperate attempt to satiate the specific appetite for protein in life References  Further reading Robert J Contreras 1989 Gustatory mechanisms of a specific appetite In Robert H

       "  'raw page text': 'Sports nutrition is the study and practice of nutrition and diet with regards to improving ones athletic performance Nutrition is an important part of many sports training regimens being popular in strength sports such as weightlifting and bodybuilding and endurance sports eg cycling running swimming rowing Sports Nutrition focuses its studies on the type as well as the quantity of fluids and food taken by an athlete In addition it deals with the consumption of nutrients such as vitamins minerals supplements and organic substances that include carbohydrates proteins and fats    Supplements Dietary supplements contain one or more dietary ingredients including vitamins minerals amino acids herbs or other botanicals and other substances or their constituents is intended to be taken by mouth as a pill capsule tablet or liquid Athletes may choose to consider taking dietary supplements to assist in improving their athletic performance There are many other supplements out there that include performance enhancing supplements steroids blood doping creatine human growth hormone energy supplements caffeine and supplements that aid in recovery protein BCAAs Energy Supplements Athletes sometimes turn to energy supplements to increase their ability to exercise more often Common supplements to increase an athletes energy include Caffeine Guarana Vitamin B12 and Asian ginseng Caffeine a common energy supplement can be found in many different forms such as pills tablets or capsules and can also be found in common foods such as coffee and tea Caffeine is used to improve energy and increases metabolism Guarana is another supplement that athletes take to enhance their athletic ability it is frequently used for weight loss and as an energy supplement A 2009 study from the University of Texas reports that caffeinated energy drinks decrease sporting performance They found that after drinking an energy drink 83 of participants improved their physical activity parameters by an average of 47 This was attributed to the effects of caffeine sucrose and Vitamin B in the drink  however scientific consensus does not support the efficacy of using Vitamin B as a performance enhancer To explain the performance improvement the writers report an increase in blood levels of epinephrine norepinephrine and betaEndorphin The adenosine receptor antagonism of caffeine accounts for the first two while the latter is accounted for by the Neurobiological effects of physical exercise Caffeine has been around since the 1900s and became popularly used in the 1970s when its power of masking fatigue became highly recognized Similarly the caffeine found in energy drinks and coffee shows an increased reaction performance and feelings of energy focus and alertness in quickness and reaction anaerobic power tests In other words consuming an energy drink or any drink with caffeine increases short timerapid exercise performance like short fullspeed sprints and heavy power weight lifting Caffeine is chemically similar to adenosine a type of sugar that helps in the regulation of important body processes including the firing of neurotransmitters Caffeine takes the place of adenosine in your brain attaching itself to the same neural receptors affected by adenosine and causing your neurons to fire more rapidly hence caffeines stimulating effects Recovery Supplements Common supplements to help athletes recover from exercising include protein and amino acid supplements The main use for athletes to take dietary proteins are for hormones oxygen transport cellular repair enzymes and conversion to fuel  The intake of protein is a part of the nutrient requirements for the normal athlete and is an important component of exercise training In addition it aids in performance and recovery Dietary protein intake for welltrained athletes should occur before during and after physical activity as it is advantageous in gaining muscle mass and strength However if too much protein and amino acid supplements is consumed it can be more harmful to the body than it is beneficial health risks include dehydration gout calcium loss liver renal damage diarrhea bloating and water loss A bountiful protein diet must be paired with a healthy wellrounded meal plan and regular resistance exercise Characteristics of this particular diet include the type of exercise intensity duration and carbohydrate values of diet The most effective way to secure the natural nutrients required by your body for optimum health and physiological performance is by eating your vitamins minerals proteins fats sugars and carbohydrates which can be procured from fresh fruits and vegetables Postexercise nutrition is an important factor in a nutrition plan for athletes as it pertains to the recovery of the body Traditionally sports drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade are consumed during and after exercise because they effectively rehydrate the body by refueling the body with minerals and electrolytes Electrolytes regulate the bodies nerve and muscle function blood pH blood pressure and the rebuilding of damaged tissue These types of drink are commonly made of glucose and sucrose in water and has been seen to improve the football players performance A substitute for sports drinks is milk which contains many electrolytes nutrients and other elements that help to make it an effective postexercise beverage It is true that milk helps replace fluids and electrolytes lost after the athlete has worked out A recovery drink is supposed to replenish the sugar lost and help recover the muscles to be able to workout at full intensity by the next time they workout When compared to plain water or sports drinks research suggests that chocolate milk is more effective at replacing fluids lost through sweat and maintaining normal body fluid levels Athletes drinking chocolate milk following exerciseinduced dehydration had fluid levels about 2 percent higher on initial body mass than those using other postexercise recovery beverages These results allowed for prolonged performance especially in repeated bouts of exercise or training Performance Enhancing Supplements In the extreme case of performanceenhancing supplements athletes particularly bodybuilders may choose to use illegal substances such as anabolic steroids These compounds which are related to the hormone testosterone can quickly build mass and strength but have many adverse effects such as high blood pressure and negative gender specific effects Blood doping another illegal ergogenic was discovered in the 1940s when it was used by World War II pilots Blood doping also known as blood transfusions increases oxygen delivery to exercising tissues and has been demonstrated to improve performance in endurance sports such as longdistance cycling  The supplement Creatine may be helpful for welltrained athletes to increase exercise performance and strength in relation with their dietary regimen The substance glutamine found in whey fiber supplements is the most abundant free amino acid found in the human body It is considered that glutamine may have a possible role in stimulated anabolic processes such as muscle glycogen and protein synthesis for welltrained and wellnourished athletes Other popular studies done on supplements include androstenedione chromium and ephedra The findings show that there are no substantial benefits from the extra intake of these supplements yet higher health risks and costs Factors influencing nutritional requirements Differing conditions and objectives suggest the need for athletes to ensure that their sports nutritional approach is appropriate for their situation Factors that may affect an athletes nutritional needs include type of activity aerobic vs anaerobic gender weight height body mass index workout or activity stage preworkout introworkout recovery and time of day eg some nutrients are utilized by the body more effectively during sleep than while awakeMost culprits that get in the way of performance are fatigue injury and soreness A proper diet will reduce these disturbances in performance The key to a proper diet is to get a variety of food and to consume all the macronutrients vitamins and minerals needed According to Ebleres article 2008 it is ideal to choose raw foods for example unprocessed foods such as oranges instead of orange juice Eating foods that are natural means the athlete is getting the most nutritional value out of the food When foods are processed the nutritional value is normally reduced Anaerobic exercise  During anaerobic exercise the process of glycolysis breaks down the sugars from carbohydrates for energy without the use of oxygen This type of exercise occurs in physical activity such as power sprints strength resistances and quick explosive movement where the muscles are being used for power and speed with shorttime energy use After this type of exercise there is a need to refill glycogen storage sites in the body the long simple sugar chains in the body that store energy although they are not likely fully depleted To compensate for this glycogen reduction athletes will often take in large amounts of carbohydrates immediately following their exercise Typically highglycemicindex carbohydrates are preferred for their ability to rapidly raise blood glucose levelsFor the purpose of protein synthesis protein or individual amino acids are ingested as well Branchedchain amino acids are important since they are most responsible for the synthesis of protein According to Lemon et al 1995 female endurance runners have the hardest time getting enough protein in their diet Endurance athletes in general need more protein in their diet than the sedentary personResearch has shown that endurance athletes are recommended to have 12 to 14 g of protein per kg of body weight in order to repair damaged tissue If the athlete consumes too few calories for the bodys needs lean tissue will be broken down for energy and repair Protein deficiency can cause many problems such as early and extreme fatigue particularly long recovery and poor wound healing Complete proteins such as meat eggs and soy provide the athlete with all essential amino acids for synthesizing new tissues However vegetarian and vegan athletes frequently combine legumes with a whole grain to provide the body with a complete protein across the days food intake A popular combination being rice and beans Spadas research on endurance sports nutrition 2000 and where the types of carbohydrates come from will be explained He advises for carbohydrates to be unprocessed andor whole grains for optimal performance while training These carbohydrates offer the most fuel nutritional value and satiety Fruits and vegetables contribute important carbohydrate foundation for an athletes diet They provide vitamins and minerals that are lost through exercise and later needed to be replenished Both fruits and vegetables improve healing aid in recovery and reduce risks of cancer high blood pressure and constipation Vegetables offer a little more nutritional value than fruits for the amount of calories therefore an athlete should strive to eat more vegetables than fruits Darkcolored vegetables usually have more nutritional value than pale colored onesadd info A general rule is the darker the color the more nutrient dense it is Like all foods it is very important to have a variety To get the most nutritional value out of fruits and vegetables it is important to eat them in their natural unprocessed form with no other nutrient sugar added Often in the continuation of this anaerobic exercise the product from this metabolic mechanism builds up in what is called lactic acid fermentation Lactate is produced more quickly than it is being removed and it serves to regenerate NAD cells on where its needed During intense exercise when oxygen is not being used a high amount of ATP is produced and pH levels fall causing acidosis or more specifically lactic acidosis Lactic acid build up can be treated by staying wellhydrated throughout and especially after the workout having an efficient cool down routine and good postworkout stretching Intense activity can cause significant and permanent damage to bodily tissues In order to repair vitamin E and other antioxidants are needed to protect muscle damage Oxidation damage and muscle tissue breakdown happens during endurance running so athletes need to eat foods high in protein in order to repair these muscle tissues It is important for female endurance runners to consume proper nutrients in their diet that will repair fuel and minimize fatigue and injury To keep a female runners body performing at its best the ten nutrients need to be included in their diets See also CategoryDietary supplements Energy bar Protein Sports drink Multivitamin

       "  'raw page text': 'Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as energy storage It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods like potatoes wheat maize corn rice and cassava Pure starch is a white tasteless and odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol It consists of two types of molecules the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin Depending on the plant starch generally contains 20 to 25 amylose and 75 to 80 amylopectin by weight Glycogen the glucose store of animals is a more highly branched version of amylopectin In industry starch is converted into sugars for example by malting and fermented to produce ethanol in the manufacture of beer whisky and biofuel It is processed to produce many of the sugars used in processed foods Mixing most starches in warm water produces a paste such as wheatpaste which can be used as a thickening stiffening or gluing agent The biggest industrial nonfood use of starch is as an adhesive in the papermaking process Starch can be applied to parts of some garments before ironing to stiffen them    Etymology The word starch is from a Germanic root with the meanings strong stiff strengthen stiffen Modern German St√§rke starch is related Amylum for starch is from the Greek ·ºÑŒºœÖŒªŒøŒΩ amylon which means not ground at a mill The root amyl is used in biochemistry for several compounds related to starch History Starch grains from the rhizomes of Typha cattails bullrushes as flour have been identified from grinding stones in Europe dating back to 30000 years ago Starch grains from sorghum were found on grind stones in caves in Ngalue Mozambique dating up to 100000 years ago Pure extracted wheat starch paste was used in Ancient Egypt possibly to glue papyrus The extraction of starch is first described in the Natural History of Pliny the Elder around AD 77‚Äì79 Romans used it also in cosmetic creams to powder the hair and to thicken sauces Persians and Indians used it to make dishes similar to gothumai wheat halva Rice starch as surface treatment of paper has been used in paper production in China since 700 CE In addition to starchy plants consumed directly 66 million tonnes of starch were being produced per year worldwide by 2008 In the EU this was around 85 million tonnes with around 40 being used for industrial applications and 60 for food uses most of the latter as glucose syrups Energy store of plants Most green plants use starch as their energy store An exception is the family Asteraceae asters daisies and sunflowers where starch is replaced by the fructan inulin In photosynthesis plants use light energy to produce glucose from carbon dioxide The glucose is used to make cellulose fibers the structural component of the plant or is stored in the form of starch granules in amyloplasts Toward the end of the growing season starch accumulates in twigs of trees near the buds Fruit seeds rhizomes and tubers store starch to prepare for the next growing season Glucose is soluble in water hydrophilic binds with water and then takes up much space and is osmotically active glucose in the form of starch on the other hand is not soluble therefore osmotically inactive and can be stored much more compactly Glucose molecules are bound in starch by the easily hydrolyzed alpha bonds The same type of bond is found in the animal reserve polysaccharide glycogen This is in contrast to many structural polysaccharides such as chitin cellulose and peptidoglycan which are bound by beta bonds and are much more resistant to hydrolysis Biosynthesis Plants produce starch by first converting glucose 1phosphate to ADPglucose using the enzyme glucose1phosphate adenylyltransferase This step requires energy in the form of ATP The enzyme starch synthase then adds the ADPglucose via a 14alpha glycosidic bond to a growing chain of glucose residues liberating ADP and creating amylose Starch branching enzyme introduces 16alpha glycosidic bonds between these chains creating the branched amylopectin The starch debranching enzyme isoamylase removes some of these branches Several isoforms of these enzymes exist leading to a highly complex synthesis process Glycogen and amylopectin have similar structure but the former has about one branch point per ten 14alpha bonds compared to about one branch point per thirty 14alpha bonds in amylopectin Amylopectin is synthesized from ADPglucose while mammals and fungi synthesize glycogen from UDPglucose for most cases bacteria synthesize glycogen from ADPglucose analogous to starch In addition to starch synthesis in plants starch can be synthesized from nonfood starch mediated by an enzyme cocktail In this cellfree biosystem beta14glycosidic bondlinked cellulose is partially hydrolyzed to cellobiose Cellobiose phosphorylase cleaves to glucose 1phosphate and glucose the other enzyme‚Äîpotato alphaglucan phosphorylase can add a glucose unit from glucose 1phosphorylase to the nonreducing ends of starch In it phosphate is internally recycled The other product glucose can be assimilated by a yeast This cellfree bioprocessing does not need any costly chemical and energy input can be conducted in aqueous solution and does not have sugar losses Degradation Starch is synthesized in plant leaves during the day and stored as granules it serves as an energy source at night The insoluble highly branched starch chains have to be phosphorylated in order to be accessible for degrading enzymes The enzyme glucan water dikinase GWD phosphorylates at the C6 position of a glucose molecule close to the chains 16alpha branching bonds A second enzyme phosphoglucan water dikinase PWD phosphorylates the glucose molecule at the C3 position A loss of these enzymes for example a loss of the GWD leads to a starch excess sex phenotype and because starch cannot be phosphorylated it accumulates in the plastids After the phosphorylation the first degrading enzyme betaamylase BAM can attack the glucose chain at its nonreducing end Maltose is released as the main product of starch degradation If the glucose chain consists of three or fewer molecules BAM cannot release maltose A second enzyme disproportionating enzyme1 DPE1 combines two maltotriose molecules From this chain a glucose molecule is released Now BAM can release another maltose molecule from the remaining chain This cycle repeats until starch is degraded completely If BAM comes close to the phosphorylated branching point of the glucose chain it can no longer release maltose In order for the phosphorylated chain to be degraded the enzyme isoamylase ISA is required The products of starch degradation are predominantly maltose and smaller amounts of glucose These molecules are exported from the plastid to the cytosol maltose via the maltose transporter which if mutated MEX1mutant results in maltose accumulation in the plastid Glucose is exported via the plastidic glucose translocator pGlcT These two sugars act as a precursor for sucrose synthesis Sucrose can then be used in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the mitochondria to generate ATP at night Properties Structure   While amylose was thought to be completely unbranched it is now known that some of its molecules contain a few branch points Amylose is a much smaller molecule than amylopectin About one quarter of the mass of starch granules in plants consist of amylose although there are about 150 times more amylose than amylopectin molecules Starch molecules arrange themselves in the plant in semicrystalline granules Each plant species has a unique starch granular size rice starch is relatively small about 2\\xa0Œºm while potato starches have larger granules up to 100\\xa0Œºm Starch becomes soluble in water when heated The granules swell and burst the semicrystalline structure is lost and the smaller amylose molecules start leaching out of the granule forming a network that holds water and increasing the mixtures viscosity This process is called starch gelatinization During cooking the starch becomes a paste and increases further in viscosity During cooling or prolonged storage of the paste the semicrystalline structure partially recovers and the starch paste thickens expelling water This is mainly caused by retrogradation of the amylose This process is responsible for the hardening of bread or staling and for the water layer on top of a starch gel syneresis Some cultivated plant varieties have pure amylopectin starch without amylose known as waxy starches The most used is waxy maize others are glutinous rice and waxy potato starch Waxy starches have less retrogradation resulting in a more stable paste High amylose starch amylomaize is cultivated for the use of its gel strength and for use as a resistant starch a starch that resists digestion in food products Synthetic amylose made from cellulose has a wellcontrolled degree of polymerization Therefore it can be used as a potential drug deliver carrier Certain starches when mixed with water will produce a nonnewtonian fluid sometimes nicknamed oobleck Hydrolysis The enzymes that break down or hydrolyze starch into the constituent sugars are known as amylases Alphaamylases are found in plants and in animals Human saliva is rich in amylase and the pancreas also secretes the enzyme Individuals from populations with a highstarch diet tend to have more amylase genes than those with lowstarch diets Betaamylase cuts starch into maltose units This process is important in the digestion of starch and is also used in brewing where amylase from the skin of seed grains is responsible for converting starch to maltose Malting Mashing Dextrinization If starch is subjected to dry heat it breaks down to form dextrins also called pyrodextrins in this context This break down process is known as dextrinization Pyrodextrins are mainly yellow to brown in color and dextrinization is partially responsible for the browning of toasted bread Chemical tests   A triiodide I3‚àí solution formed by mixing iodine and iodide usually from potassium iodide is used to test for starch a dark blue color indicates the presence of starch The details of this reaction are not yet fully known but it is thought that the iodine I3‚àí and I5‚àí ions fit inside the coils of amylose the charge transfers between the iodine and the starch and the energy level spacings in the resulting complex correspond to the absorption spectrum in the visible light region The strength of the resulting blue color depends on the amount of amylose present Waxy starches with little or no amylose present will color red Benedicts test and Fehlings test is also done to indicate the presence of starch Starch indicator solution consisting of water starch and iodide is often used in redox titrations in the presence of an oxidizing agent the solution turns blue in the presence of reducing agent the blue color disappears because triiodide I3‚àí ions break up into three iodide ions disassembling the starchiodine complex A 03 ww solution is the standard concentration for a starch indicator It is made by adding 3\\xa0grams of soluble starch to 1 liter of heated water the solution is cooled before use starchiodine complex becomes unstable at temperatures above 35\\xa0¬∞C Each species of plant has a unique type of starch granules in granular size shape and crystallization pattern Under the microscope starch grains stained with iodine illuminated from behind with polarized light show a distinctive Maltese cross effect also known as extinction cross and birefringence Food Starch is the most common carbohydrate in the human diet and is contained in many staple foods The major sources of starch intake worldwide are the cereals rice wheat and maize and the root vegetables potatoes and cassava Many other starchy foods are grown some only in specific climates including acorns arrowroot arracacha bananas barley breadfruit buckwheat canna colacasia katakuri kudzu malanga millet oats oca polynesian arrowroot sago sorghum sweet potatoes rye taro chestnuts water chestnuts and yams and many kinds of beans such as favas lentils mung beans peas and chickpeas Widely used prepared foods containing starch are bread pancakes cereals noodles pasta porridge and tortilla Digestive enzymes have problems digesting crystalline structures Raw starch is digested poorly in the duodenum and small intestine while bacterial degradation takes place mainly in the colon When starch is cooked the digestibility is increased Starch gelatinization during cake baking can be impaired by sugar competing for water preventing gelatinization and improving texture Before the advent of processed foods people consumed large amounts of uncooked and unprocessed starchcontaining plants which contained high amounts of resistant starch Microbes within the large intestine fermented the starch produced shortchain fatty acids which are used as energy and support the maintenance and growth of the microbes More highly processed foods are more easily digested and release more glucose in the small intestine‚Äîless starch reaches the large intestine and more energy is absorbed by the body It is thought that this shift in energy delivery as a result of eating more processed foods may be one of the contributing factors to the development of metabolic disorders of modern life including obesity and diabetes Starch industry The starch industry extracts and refines starches from seeds roots and tubers by wet grinding washing sieving and drying Today the main commercial refined starches are cornstarch tapioca arrowroot and wheat rice and potato starches To a lesser extent sources of refined starch are sweet potato sago and mung bean To this day starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants Untreated starch requires heat to thicken or gelatinize When a starch is precooked it can then be used to thicken instantly in cold water This is referred to as a pregelatinized starch Starch sugars Starch can be hydrolyzed into simpler carbohydrates by acids various enzymes or a combination of the two The resulting fragments are known as dextrins The extent of conversion is typically quantified by dextrose equivalent DE which is roughly the fraction of the glycosidic bonds in starch that have been broken These starch sugars are by far the most common starch based food ingredient and are used as sweeteners in many drinks and foods They include Maltodextrin a lightly hydrolyzed DE 10‚Äì20 starch product used as a blandtasting filler and thickener Various glucose syrups DE 30‚Äì70 also called corn syrups in the US viscous solutions used as sweeteners and thickeners in many kinds of processed foods Dextrose DE 100 commercial glucose prepared by the complete hydrolysis of starch High fructose syrup made by treating dextrose solutions with the enzyme glucose isomerase until a substantial fraction of the glucose has been converted to fructose In the United States sugar prices are two to three times higher than in the rest of the world high fructose corn syrup is significantly cheaper and is the principal sweetener used in processed foods and beverages Fructose also has better microbiological stability One kind of high fructose corn syrup HFCS55 is sweeter than sucrose because it is made with more fructose while the sweetness of HFCS42 is on par with sucrose Sugar alcohols such as maltitol erythritol sorbitol mannitol and hydrogenated starch hydrolysate are sweeteners made by reducing sugars Modified starches A modified starch is a starch that has been chemically modified to allow the starch to function properly under conditions frequently encountered during processing or storage such as high heat high shear low pH freezethaw and cooling The modified food starches are E coded according to the International Numbering System for Food Additives INS 1400 Dextrin 1401 Acidtreated starch 1402 Alkalinetreated starch 1403 Bleached

INS 1400 1401 1402 1403 and 1405 are in the EU food ingredients without an Enumber Typical modified starches for technical applications are cationic starches hydroxyethyl starch and carboxymethylated starches Use as food additive As an additive for food processing food starches are typically used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods such as puddings custards soups sauces gravies pie fillings and salad dressings and to make noodles and pastas Function as thickeners extenders emulsion stabilizers and are exceptional binders in processed meats Gummed sweets such as jelly beans and wine gums are not manufactured using a mold in the conventional sense A tray is filled with native starch and leveled A positive mold is then pressed into the starch leaving an impression of 1000 or so jelly beans The jelly mix is then poured into the impressions and put onto a stove to set This method greatly reduces the number of molds that must be manufactured Use in pharmaceutical industry In the pharmaceutical industry starch is also used as an excipient as tablet disintegrant and as binder Resistant starch  Resistant starch is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals High amylose starch from corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch and retains its resistant starch content through baking mild extrusion and other food processing techniques It is used as an insoluble dietary fiber in processed foods such as bread pasta cookies crackers pretzels and other low moisture foods It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits Published studies have shown that resistant starch helps to improve insulin sensitivity increases satiety and improves markers of colonic function It has been suggested that resistant starch contributes to the health benefits of intact whole grains Industrial applications  Papermaking Papermaking is the largest nonfood application for starches globally consuming millions of metric tons annually In a typical sheet of copy paper for instance the starch content may be as high as 8 Both chemically modified and unmodified starches are used in papermaking In the wet part of the papermaking process generally called the wetend the starches used are cationic and have a positive charge bound to the starch polymer These starch derivatives associate with the anionic or negatively charged paper fibers  cellulose and inorganic fillers Cationic starches together with other retention and internal sizing agents help to give the necessary strength properties to the paper web formed in the papermaking process wet strength and to provide strength to the final paper sheet dry strength In the dry end of the papermaking process the paper web is rewetted with a starch based solution The process is called surface sizing Starches used have been chemically or enzymatically depolymerized at the paper mill or by the starch industry oxidized starch The sizestarch solutions are applied to the paper web by means of various mechanical presses size presses Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the paper web and additionally provide water hold out or size for superior printing properties Starch is also used in paper coatings as one of the binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments binders and thickeners Coated paper has improved smoothness hardness whiteness and gloss and thus improves printing characteristics Corrugated board adhesives Corrugated board adhesives are the next largest application of nonfood starches globally Starch glues are mostly based on unmodified native starches plus some additive such as borax and caustic soda Part of the starch is gelatinized to carry the slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive The glue is applied on tips of the fluting The fluted paper is pressed to paper called liner This is then dried under high heat which causes the rest of the uncooked starch in glue to swellgelatinize This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for corrugated board production Clothing starch Clothing or laundry starch is a liquid prepared by mixing a vegetable starch in water earlier preparations also had to be boiled and is used in the laundering of clothes Starch was widely used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and ruffs of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the welltodo During the 19th and early 20th century it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of mens shirts and the ruffles of womens petticoats by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being ironed Starch gave clothing smooth crisp edges and had an additional practical purpose dirt and sweat from a persons neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing The dirt would wash away along with the starch after laundering the starch would be reapplied Today starch is sold in aerosol cans for home use Other Another large nonfood starch application is in the construction industry where starch is used in the gypsum wall board manufacturing process Chemically modified or unmodified starches are added to the stucco containing primarily gypsum Top and bottom heavyweight sheets of paper are applied to the formulation and the process is allowed to heat and cure to form the eventual rigid wall board The starches act as a glue for the cured gypsum rock with the paper covering and also provide rigidity to the board Starch is used in the manufacture of various adhesives or glues for bookbinding wallpaper adhesives paper sack production tube winding gummed paper envelope adhesives school glues and bottle labeling Starch derivatives such as yellow dextrins can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work some of those forms use borax or soda ash which are mixed with the starch solution at 50‚Äì70\\xa0¬∞C 122‚Äì158\\xa0¬∞F to create a very good adhesive Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula Textile chemicals from starch warp sizing agents are used to reduce breaking of yarns during weaving Starch is mainly used to size cotton based yarns Modified starch is also used as textile printing thickener In oil exploration starch is used to adjust the viscosity of drilling fluid which is used to lubricate the drill head and suspend the grinding residue in petroleum extraction Starch is also used to make some packing peanuts and some drop ceiling tiles In the printing industry food grade starch is used in the manufacture of antisetoff spray powder used to separate printed sheets of paper to avoid wet ink being set off For body powder powdered corn starch is used as a substitute for talcum powder and similarly in other health and beauty products Starch is used to produce various bioplastics synthetic polymers that are biodegradable An example is polylactic acid based on glucose from starch Glucose from starch can be further fermented to biofuel corn ethanol using the socalled wet milling process Today most bioethanol production plants use the dry milling process to ferment corn or other feedstock directly to ethanol Hydrogen production could use glucose form starch as the raw material using enzymes Occupational safety and health The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit Permissible exposure limit for starch exposure in the workplace as 15\\xa0mgm3 total exposure and 5\\xa0mgm3 respiratory exposure over an 8hour workday The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a Recommended exposure limit REL of 10\\xa0mgm3 total exposure and 5\\xa0mgm3

       "  'raw page text': 'Superfood is a marketing term used to describe foods with supposed health benefits The term is not in common use by dietitians and nutrition scientists many of whom dispute that particular foods have the health benefits often claimed by their advocates Catherine Collins for instance the chief dietitian at St Georges Hospital in London has stated that the term superfoods is at best meaningless and at worst harmful There are so many wrong ideas about superfoods that I dont know where best to begin to dismantle the whole concept    Definition and use of the term According to Cancer Research UK the term superfood is really just a marketing tool with little scientific basis to it The Macmillan Dictionary defines superfood as a food that is considered to be very good for your health and that may even help some medical conditions The Oxford Dictionary definition states a superfood is ‚Äúa nutrientrich food considered to be especially beneficial for health and wellbeing The European Food Information Council stated that it was impractical for consumers to have a diet based only on presumed superfoods when nutrients are provided readily from a diet using diverse foods especially including fruits and vegetables As of 2007 the marketing of products as superfoods is prohibited in the European Union unless accompanied by a specific authorized health claim supported by credible scientific research The ruling was issued to guide marketing by manufacturers to assure proof of scientific evidence for why a particular food would be labeled as healthy or classified as a superfood Examples  Berries remain only under preliminary research and are not yet certain of providing health benefits Specifically blueberries as a popular superfood example are not especially nutrientdense considered to be a superfood characteristic having moderate content of only three essential nutrients vitamin C an antioxidant vitamin K and manganese Blueberries are commonly branded as having a high dose of antioxidants particularly anthocyanins for which antioxidant properties have been demonstrated only in vitro However this antioxidant effect is not conserved after anthocyaninrich plant foods are consumed As interpreted by the Linus Pauling Institute and European Food Safety Authority dietary anthocyanins and other flavonoids have little or no direct antioxidant food value following digestion A food such as spinach or kale by contrast contains many nutrients rich in content and so may confer nutritional benefits beyond those of other foods moderate in nutrient content such as berries Superfruits  Superfruit is a marketing term first used in the food and beverage industry in 2004 Superfruit has no official definition in major consumer markets eg Europe or the United States by regulatory authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration or US Department of Agriculture The designation of a fruit as a superfruit is entirely up to the product manufacturer as the term is primarily a marketing tool used to create consumer demand Keys to marketing a successful superfruit product include the native fruit qualities scientific evidence suggesting a potential health benefit marketing protection of intellectual property and developing a strategy to attract consumers Combined in the right way these elements may allow a fruit to achieve critical mass as a superfruit To date superfruits have been developed mainly as juices but began in 2007 to appear as singlepiece products or as ingredients for functional foods confectioneries and cosmetics Current industry development includes applications for creating novel consumer products such as energy drinks dietary supplements and flavors with nutrient qualities eg fortified water popcorn or snack chips Although used in new food and beverage products superfruits remain undefined by scientific criteria that would allow consumers to objectively assess nutrient value and potential for furnishing health benefits Consequently the term superfruit is used liberally to include fruits having sparse scientific evidence for being super other than being relatively unknown to common consumers Significance The superfruit category is a relatively new marketing approach for promoting common or rare fruits used as raw materials and ingredients for the global industries of functional foods beverages and nutraceuticals The fruits may have nutritional significance due to their nutrient content antioxidant value anticipated health benefits and commercial significance associated with novelty of taste color number of food or beverage product formats or potential to stimulate future products with innovative packaging and labeling In 2007 the superfoods category was forecast to become a billion dollar global industry by 2011 with several thousand new superfruit products expected to enter the marketplace According to Datamonitor superfruit product launches grew at a rate of 67 over 2007‚Äì2008 but underwent significant category erosion beginning in 2011 when introductions of food and nonfood products featuring pomegranate a√ßa√≠ or goji declined by 56 for the period 2011‚Äì2012 versus 2009‚Äì2010 Origin and background  More than a dozen industry publications on functional foods and beverages have referred to various exotic or antioxidant species as superfruits with estimates for some 10000 new product introductions in 2007‚Äì2008 Relatively rare fruits originating from Oceania noni China goji seabuckthorn Southeast Asia mangosteen or tropical South America a√ßa√≠ unknown to American consumers were among the first wave of superfruits successfully used in product manufacturing from 2005 to 2010 but their popularity declined through 2013 being replaced in part by new entries from southern Africa baobab and northern Europe forest berries Consumer interest in new products using pomegranate remained consistent through 2013 However definition of a superfruit remains obscure with no scientific standards or commercial criteria accepted uniformly in the industry Mainstream consumers initially seemed to accept juices of fruits that would not be popular in fresh form such as noni and pomegranate\\xa0‚Äì two of the largest selling juices Tahitian Noni began selling noni juice in 1996 and claimed billions of dollars in sales during their first 10 years of operation Earlier reports showed pomegranatebased products grew nearly 400 over 2005‚Äì2007 from new launches a gain exceeding all the previous 6 years Similarly XanGo a multiplefruit juice containing mangosteen juice grew from 40 million in sales in 2002 to 200 million in 2005 One strategy used by manufacturers has been to employ superfruits to enhance the flavor of food products attempting to mask tastes or provide impressions of novelty and health Five thousand new products were introduced in 2005 on berries alone while the superfruit category was one of the top 10 global trends in consumer products in 2008 By 2013 however innovation in superfruit products appeared to be generally declining with fewer new introductions to the category Over the years 2011 to 2015 however the number of food or beverage products containing the words superfood superfruit or supergrain had doubled Potential health effects Cancer Research UK note that superfoods are often promoted as having an ability to prevent or cure diseases including cancer they caution you shouldnt rely on socalled superfoods to reduce the risk of cancer They cannot substitute for a generally healthy and balanced diet Possible health benefits and effects of foods described as superfoods are often disputed or unsupported by scientific studies For example in one study raw cocoa had positive effects on blood pressure and markers of heart health while other research indicated less certainty about the possible effects of cocoa on cardiovascular disease Criticism The term superfood has been criticized as only a marketing device According to Catherine Collins chief dietitian at St Georges Hospital in London usage of the term can actually be harmful when applied to foods which have drawbacks The Dutch food safety organization Voedingscentrum presented some health claims that marketers use in selling many socalled superfoods such as goji berry hempseed chia seeds and wheatgrass and notes that such claims are not scientifically proven The organisation warns that people who go to extremes in their conviction and consume large quantities of specific superfoods end up with an impaired onesided diet Historically food fads come and go for example in the early 1900s bananas may have been named the first superfood as they were praised to be sealed by nature in practically germproof packages by the Journal of the American Medical Association and touted as a treatment for celiac disease Also concerning possible anticancer effects of green tea a review of research and promotion produced a 2013

       "  'raw page text': 'A tannin or tannoid is an astringent polyphenolic biomolecule that binds to and precipitates proteins and various other organic compounds including amino acids and alkaloids The term tannin from tanna an Old High German word for oak or fir tree as in Tannenbaum refers to the use of wood tannins from oak in tanning animal hides into leather hence the words tan and tanning for the treatment of leather However the term tannin by extension is widely applied to any large polyphenolic compound containing sufficient hydroxyls and other suitable groups such as carboxyls to form strong complexes with various macromolecules The tannin compounds are widely distributed in many species of plants where they play a role in protection from predation and perhaps also as pesticides and might help in regulating plant growth The astringency from the tannins is what causes the dry and puckery feeling in the mouth following the consumption of unripened fruit or red wine or tea Likewise the destruction or modification of tannins with time plays an important role when determining harvesting times Tannins have molecular weights ranging from 500 to over 3000 gallic acid esters and up to 20000 proanthocyanidins    Structure and classes of tannins There are three major classes of tannins Shown below are the base unit or monomer of the tannin Particularly in the flavonederived tannins the base shown must be additionally heavily hydroxylated and polymerized in order to give the high molecular weight polyphenol motif that characterizes tannins Typically tannin molecules require at least 12 hydroxyl groups and at least five phenyl groups to function as protein binders Oligostilbenoids oligo or polystilbenes are oligomeric forms of stilbenoids and constitute a class of tannins Pseudo tannins Pseudo tannins are low molecular weight compounds associated with other compounds They do not change color during the Goldbeaters skin test unlike hydrolysable and condensed tannins and cannot be used as tanning compounds Some examples of pseudo tannins and their sources are History Ellagic acid gallic acid and pyrogallic acid were first discovered by chemist Henri Braconnot in 1831 Julius L√∂we was the first person to synthesize ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide\\xa0 Maximilian Nierenstein studied natural phenols and tannins found in different plant species Working with Arthur George Perkin he prepared ellagic acid from algarobilla and certain other fruits in 1905 He suggested its formation from galloylglycine by Penicillium in 1915 Tannase is an enzyme that Nierenstein used to produce mdigallic acid from gallotannins He proved the presence of catechin in cocoa beans in 1931 He showed in 1945 that luteic acid a molecule present in the myrobalanitannin a tannin found in the fruit of Terminalia chebula is an intermediary compound in the synthesis of ellagic acid At these times molecule formulas were determined through combustion analysis The discovery in 1943 by Martin and Synge of paper chromatography provided for the first time the means of surveying the phenolic constituents of plants and for their separation and identification There was an explosion of activity in this field after 1945 including prominent work by Edgar Charles BateSmith and Tony Swain at Cambridge University In 1966 Edwin Haslam proposed a first comprehensive definition of plant polyphenols based on the earlier proposals of BateSmith Swain and Theodore White which includes specific structural characteristics common to all phenolics having a tanning property It is referred to as the White‚ÄìBateSmith‚ÄìSwain‚ÄìHaslam WBSSH definition Occurrence Tannins are distributed in species throughout the plant kingdom They are commonly found in both gymnosperms as well as angiosperms Mole studied the distribution of tannin in 180 families of dicotyledons and 44 families of monocotyledons Cronquist Most families of dicot contain tanninfree species tested by their ability to precipitate proteins The best known families of which all species tested contain tannin are Aceraceae Actinidiaceae Anacardiaceae Bixaceae Burseraceae Combretaceae Dipterocarpaceae Ericaceae Grossulariaceae Myricaceae for dicot and Najadaceae and Typhaceae in Monocot To the family of the oak Fagaceae 73 of the species tested N  22 contain tannin For those of acacias Mimosaceae only 39 of the species tested N  28 contain tannin among Solanaceae rate drops to 6 and 4 for the Asteraceae Some families like the Boraginaceae Cucurbitaceae Papaveraceae contain no tanninrich species The most abundant polyphenols are the condensed tannins found in virtually all families of plants and comprising up to 50 of the dry weight of leaves Tannins of tropical woods tend to be of a cathetic nature rather than of the gallic type present in temperate woods There may be a loss in the bioavailability of still other tannins in plants due to birds pests and other pathogens Localization in plant organs Tannins are found in leaf bud seed root and stem tissues An example of the location of the tannins in stem tissue is that they are often found in the growth areas of trees such as the secondary phloem and xylem and the layer between the cortex and epidermis Tannins may help regulate the growth of these tissues Cellular localization In all vascular plants studied so far tannins are manufactured by a chloroplastderived organelle the tannosome Tannins are mainly physically located in the vacuoles or surface wax of plants These storage sites keep tannins active against plant predators but also keep some tannins from affecting plant metabolism while the plant tissue is alive it is only after cell breakdown and death that the tannins are active in metabolic effects Tannins are classified as ergastic substances ie nonprotoplasm materials found in cells Tannins by definition precipitate proteins In this condition they must be stored in organelles able to withstand the protein precipitation process Idioblasts are isolated plant cells which differ from neighboring tissues and contain nonliving substances They have various functions such as storage of reserves excretory materials pigments and minerals They could contain oil latex gum resin or pigments etc They also can contain tannins In Japanese persimmon Diospyros kaki fruits tannin is accumulated in the vacuole of tannin cells which are idioblasts of parenchyma cells in the flesh Presence in soils  The convergent evolution of tanninrich plant communities has occurred on nutrientpoor acidic soils throughout the world Tannins were once believed to function as antiherbivore defenses but more and more ecologists now recognize them as important controllers of decomposition and nitrogen cycling processes As concern grows about global warming there is great interest to better understand the role of polyphenols as regulators of carbon cycling in particular in northern boreal forests Leaf litter and other decaying parts of kauri Agathis australis a tree species found in New Zealand decompose much more slowly than those of most other species Besides its acidity the plant also bears substances such as waxes and phenols most notably tannins that are harmful to microorganisms Presence in water and wood The leaching of highly water soluble tannins from decaying vegetation and leaves along a stream may produce what is known as a blackwater river Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown color from dissolved peat tannins The presence of tannins or humic acid in well water can make it smell bad or taste bitter but this does not make it unsafe to drink Tannins leaching from an unprepared driftwood decoration in an aquarium can cause pH lowering and coloring of the water to a tealike tinge A way to avoid this is to boil the wood in water several times discarding the water each time Using peat as an aquarium substrate can have the same effect Many hours of boiling the driftwood may need to be followed by many weeks or months of constant soaking and many water changes before the water will stay clear Adding baking soda to the water to raise its pH level will accelerate the process of leaching as the more alkaline solution can draw out tannic acid from the wood faster than the pHneutral water Softwoods while in general much lower in tannins than hardwoods are usually not recommended for use in an aquarium so using a hardwood with a very light color indicating a low tannin content can be an easy way to avoid tannins Tannic acid is brown in color so in general white woods have a low tannin content Woods with a lot of yellow red or brown coloration to them like southern yellow pine cedar redwood red oak etc tend to contain a lot of tannin Extraction There is no single protocol for extracting tannins from all plant material The procedures used for tannins are widely variable It may be that acetone in the extraction solvent increases the total yield by inhibiting interactions between tannins and proteins during extraction or even by breaking hydrogen bonds between tanninprotein complexes Tests for tannins There are three groups of methods for the analysis of tannins precipitation of proteins or alkaloids reaction with phenolic rings and depolymerization Alkaloid precipitation Alkaloids such as caffeine cinchonine quinine or strychnine precipitates polyphenols and tannins This property can be used in a quantitation method Goldbeaters skin test When goldbeaters

The mixture is boiled for five minutes Two drops of 5 FeCl3 are then added Production of a greenish precipitate was an indication of the presence of tannins Alternatively a portion of the water extract is diluted with distilled water in a ratio of 14 and few drops of 10 ferric chloride solution is added A blue or green color indicates the presence of tannins Evans 1989 Other methods The hidepowder method is used in tannin analysis for leather tannin and the Stiasny method for wood adhesives Statistical analysis reveals that there is no significant relationship between the results from the hidepowder and the Stiasny methods Hidepowder method 400\\xa0mg of sample tannins are dissolved in 100\\xa0ml of distilled water 3\\xa0g of slightly chromated hidepowder previously dried in vacuum for 24h over CaCl2 are added and the mixture stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature The suspension is filtered without vacuum through a sintered glass filter The weight gain of the hidepowder expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting material is equated to the percentage of tannin in the sample Stiasnys method 100\\xa0mg of sample tannins are dissolved in 10\\xa0ml distilled

tannins of Commiphora angolensis have been revealed by the usual color and precipitation reactions and by quantitative determination by the methods of L√∂wenthalProcter and of Deijs formalinhydrochloric acid method Colorimetric methods have existed such as the NeubauerL√∂wenthal method which uses potassium permanganate as an oxidizing agent and indigo sulfate as an indicator originally proposed by L√∂wenthal in 1877 The difficulty is that the establishing of a titer for tannin is not always convenient since it is extremely difficult to obtain the pure tannin Neubauer proposed to remove this difficulty by establishing the titer not with regard to the tannin but with regard to crystallised oxalic acid whereby he found that 83\\xa0g oxalic acid correspond to 4120\\xa0g tannin L√∂wenthals method has been criticized For instance the amount of indigo used is not sufficient to retard noticeably the oxidation of the nontannins substances The results obtained by this method are therefore only comparative A modified method proposed in 1903 for the quantification of tannins in wine Feldmanns method is making use of calcium hypochlorite instead of potassium permanganate and indigo sulfate Food items with tannins Pomegranates  Accessory fruits Strawberries contain both hydrolyzable and condensed tannins Berries  Most berries such as cranberries and blueberries contain both hydrolyzable and condensed tannins Nuts Nuts that can be consumed raw such as hazelnuts walnuts and pecans contain high amounts of tannins Almonds have a lower content Tannin concentration in the crude extract of these nuts did not directly translate to the same relationships for the condensed fraction Herbs and spices Cloves tarragon cumin thyme vanilla and cinnamon all contain tannins Legumes Most legumes contain tannins Redcolored beans contain the most tannins and whitecolored beans have the least Peanuts without shells have a very low tannin content Chickpeas garbanzo beans have a smaller amount of tannins Chocolate Chocolate liquor contains about 6 tannins Drinks with tannins  Principal human dietary sources of tannins are tea and coffee Most wines aged in charred oak barrels possess tannins absorbed from the wood Soils high in clay also contribute to tannins in wine grapes This concentration gives wine its signature bitterness Coffee pulp has been found to contain low to trace amounts of tannins Fruit juices Although citrus fruits do not themselves contain tannins orangecolored juices often contain food dyes with tannins Apple juice grape juices and berry juices are all high in tannins Sometimes tannins are even added to juices and ciders to create a more astringent feel to the taste Beer In addition to the alpha acids extracted from hops to provide bitterness in beer condensed tannins are also present These originate both from the malt and hops Especially in Germany trained brewmasters consider the presence of tannins as a flaw In some styles the presence of this astringency is acceptable or even desired as for example in a Flanders red ale In lager type beers the tannins can form a precipitate with specific hazeforming proteins in the beer resulting in turbidity at low temperature This chill haze can be prevented by removing part of the tannins or part of the hazeforming proteins Tannins are removed using PVPP hazeforming proteins by using silica or tannic acid Health effects of tannins  Properties for animal nutrition Tannins have traditionally been considered antinutritional but it is now known that their beneficial or antinutritional properties depend upon their chemical structure and dosage The new technologies used to analyze molecular and chemical structures have shown that a division into condensed and hydrolyzable tannins is too simplistic Recent studies have demonstrated that products containing chestnut tannins included at low dosages 015‚Äì02 in the diet of chickens may be beneficial Some studies suggest that chestnut tannins have positive effects on silage quality in the round bale silages in particular reducing NPNs non protein nitrogen in the lowest wilting level Improved fermentability of soya meal nitrogen in the rumen may occur Studies conducted in 2002 on in vitro ammonia release and dry matter degradation of soybean meal comparing three different types of tannins quebracho acacia and chestnut demonstrated that chestnut tannins are more efficient in protecting soybean meal from in vitro degradation by rumen bacteria Condensed tannins inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes for more on that topic see plant defense against herbivory Many tanninconsuming animals secrete a tanninbinding protein mucin in their saliva Tanninbinding capacity of salivary mucin is directly related to its proline content Salivary prolinerich proteins PRPs are sometimes used to inactivate tannins One reason is that they inactivate tannins to a greater extent than do dietary proteins resulting in reduced fecal nitrogen losses PRPs additionally contain nonspecific nitrogen and nonessential amino acids making them more convenient than valuable dietary protein Histatins another type of salivary proteins also precipitate tannins from solution thus preventing alimentary adsorption Tannin market  Tannin production began at the beginning of the 19th century with the industrial revolution to produce tanning material for the need for more leather Before that time processes used plant material and were long up to six months There was a collapse in the vegetable tannin market in the 1950s‚Äì1960s due to the appearance of synthetic tannins which were invented in response to a scarcity of vegetable tannins during World War II At that time many small tannin industry sites closed Vegetable tannins are estimated to be used for the production of 10‚Äì20 of the global leather production The cost of the final product depends on the method used to extract the tannins in particular the use of solvents alkali and other chemicals used for instance glycerin For large quantities the most costeffective method is hot water extraction Tannic acid is used worldwide as clarifying agent in alcoholic drinks and as aroma ingredient in both alcoholic and soft drinks or juices Tannins from different botanical origins also find extensive uses in the wine industry Uses Tannins are an important ingredient in the process of tanning leather Tanbark from oak mimosa chestnut and quebracho tree has traditionally been the primary source of tannery tannin though inorganic tanning agents are also in use today and account for 90 of the worlds leather production Tannins produce different colors with ferric chloride either blue blue black or green to greenishblack according to the type of tannin Iron gall ink is produced by treating a solution of tannins with ironII sulfate Tannin is a component in a type of industrial particleboard adhesive developed jointly by the Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organization and Forintek Labs Canada Pinus radiata tannins has been investigated for the production of wood adhesives Condensed tannins eg quebracho tannin and Hydrolyzable tannins eg chestnut tannin appear to be able to substitute a high proportion of synthetic phenol in phenolformaldehyde resins for wood particleboard Tannins can be used for production of anticorrosive primer sold under brandname Nox Primer for treatment of rusted steel surfaces prior to painting rust converter to transform oxidized steel into a smooth sealed surface and rust inhibitor The use of resins made of tannins has been investigated to remove mercury and methylmercury from solution Immobilized tannins have been tested to recover uranium from seawater See also Polyphenol References  External

       "  'raw page text': 'Thrombosis prevention also known as thrombosis prophylaxis are treatments to prevent the formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel Some people are at a higher risk for the formation of blood clots than others Prevention measures or interventions are usually begun after surgery as people are at higher risk due to immobility There are medicationbased interventions and nonmedicationbased interventions The risk of developing blood clots can be modified by life style modifications the discontinuation of oral contraceptives and weight loss In those at high risk both interventions are often used The treatments to prevent the formation of blood clots is balanced against the risk of bleeding One of the goals of blood clot prevention is to limit venous stasis as this is a significant risk factor for forming blood clots in the deep veins of the legs Venous stasis can occur during the long periods of not moving Thrombosis prevention is also recommended during air travel Thrombosis prophylaxis is effective in preventing the formation of blood clots their lodging in the veins and their developing into thromboemboli that can travel through the circulatory system to cause blockage and subsequent tissue death in other organs Clarence Crafoord is credited with the first use of thrombosis prophylaxis in the 1930s    Pathophysicology of blood clot prevention  The development of blood clots can be interrupted and prevented by the use of medication changing risk factors and other interventions Some risk factors can be modified These would be losing weight increasing exercise and the cessation of oral contraceptives Moving during periods of travel is a modifiable behavior Preventing blood clots includes the use of medications that interrupt the complex clotting cascade and changing the proteins that are needed for clotting Antiplatelet drugs also have an effect in preventing the formation of clots If a blood clot has already formed in a blood vessel treatment will differ significantly from clot prevention Hemolytic medications are used These are medications that will help dissolve the clot Physical interventions then become contraindicated due to the risk of the clot migrating to distant locations like the heart brain and lungs Once a clot has formed a person will be prescribed bed rest and remain relatively immobile until it the clot is undetectable Medical treatments Thrombosis prophylaxis is not only used for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis but can be initiated for the prevention of the formation of blood clots in other organs and circumstances unrelated to deep vein thrombosis  Epidemiology of developing blood clots The risk of developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is different than the total risk of the formation of blood clots This is due to the observation that not all blood clots form in the lower legs Most hospitalized medical patients have at least 1 risk factor for thrombosis that progresses to thromboembolism and this risk persists weeks after discharge Those who remain undiagnosed and not treated prophylacticly have a 26 chance of suffering a fatal embolism Another 26 develop another embolism Between 5 and 10 of all in hospital deaths are due to pulmonary embolism as a consequence of thrombosis Estimates of the incidence of pulmonary embolism in the US is 01 personsyear Hospital admissions in the US for pulmonary embolism are 200000 to 300000 yearly Thrombosis that develops into DVT will affect 900000 people and kill up to 100000 in the US On average 28726 hospitalized adults aged 18 and older with a VTE blood clot diagnosis die each year Risk of thrombosis is related to hospitalization In 2005 the UK the Parliamentary Health Select Committee determined the annual rate of death due to thrombosis was 25000 with at least 50 being hospitalacquired The type of surgery performed prior to the formation of blood clots influences the risk Without prophylactic interventions the calculated incidence of clot formation in the lower leg veins after surgery is 22 for neurosurgery 26 for abdominal surgery 45 for 60 in orthopedic surgery 14 for gynecologic surgery As the population of the US ages the development of blood clots is becoming more common General risks and indications for blood clot prevention Some risk factors for developing blood clots are considered higher that others One scoring system analyzes the probability for clot formation by assigning a point value system to significant risk factors The benefit of treating those who are at low risk of developing blood clots may not outweigh the higher risks of significant bleeding   Risk for subsequent blood clots Developing blood clots is more probable after the first episode Risk assessment and intervention for those with one or more episodes of deep vein thrombosis or blood clots in the veins utilizes the Wells test It has been inconsistently modified by a number of publishers with the results listed below Wells and modified Wells risk scoring Adapted for the emergency room Scoring less than 2 points low risk 3 26 points modertate risk 17 gt 6 points high risk 75 General interventions The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued general guidelines describing the interventions that can be taken to reduce the risk of the formation of blood clots   Interventions during travel Seatedge pressure from the seat on an airplane on the popliteal area may contribute to vessel wall damage as well as venous stasis Coagulation activation may result from an interaction between cabin conditions such as hypobaric hypoxia and individual risk factors for the formation of blood clots Studies of the pathophysiologic mechanisms for the increased risk of Venous thrombosis embolism or VTE after longdistance travel have not produced consistent results but venous stasis appears to play a major role other factors specific to air travel may increase coagulation activation particularly in passengers with individual risk factors for VTE Interventions for those hospitalized Compression devices The use of fitted intermittent pneumatic compression devices before during and after procedures is another way to It consists of an air pump and inflatable auxiliary compartments that sequentially inflates and deflated to provide an external pump that returns venous blood toward the heart The use of intermittent pneumatic compression is common These devices are also placed on a surgical patient in the operating room the intrasurgical period and remain on the person while recovering from the surgery The application of antiembolism stockings TED stockings can be used to prevent thrombosis The correct use and properly fitted graded compression stockings can reduce the rate of thrombosis by 50 Contraindications for the use of antiembolism stockings include the presence of advanced peripheral and obstructive arterial disease septic phlebitis heart failure open wounds dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy Differences between the use of thighhigh compression stockings and shorter types to prevent blood clots exist but remain inconsistent Assessment There has been some success in preventing blood clots by an early assessment risk upon admission to the hospital This strategy for preventing blood clots is the Centers for Disease and preventions program that recognizes procedural prevention Hospitals participated in this effort to reduce the incidence of thrombosis In some instances the rates of DVT were decreased Some of the hospitals developed a mandatory assessment quantifying the risk for developing blood clots and a plan of care developed from the assessment The persons risk for developing blood clots is entered into their record ‚Äòfollowing‚Äô them through their treatment regime If the hospital stay exceeded three days the person was reassessed for risk Clinicians were then able to apply protocols for prevention based upon best clinical practices Interventions to treat immobility  Immobility is a significant risk factor in the development of thrombosis Immediate postsurgical interventionsout of bed orders OOB are typically ordered by the physician to prevent thrombosis These orders are typically delegated to a nurse but may include the participation of a physical therapist and others trained to perform the intervention are to perform range of motion ROM activities that include muscle contractions of the lower legs for those who are very weak moving the feet wiggling the toes bending the knees raise and lower the legs In addition changes in positioning prevents immobility and shifts areas of venous stasis If the person is too weak to perform these preventative activities hospital personnel will perform these movements independently Exercise of the lower extremeties is a postoperative method of prophlaxsis Nursing personnel will often perform range of motion exercises and encourage frequent moving of the legs feet and ankles Frequent positioning changes and adequate fluid intake After a surgical procedure ambulation as soon as possible is prophylactic in preventing the formation of blood clots Early ambulation also prevents venous stasis and physicians order OOB activities on the same day of surgery This is accomplished in increments The progression of increasing mobility proceeds by raising the head of the bed sitting up in bed moving to the edge of the bed dangling the legs off the bed and then ambulating to a close chair Patient education and compliance reduces the risk of developing blood clots These excerises and use of equipment and follow up by clinicians reduces the risk of developing blood clots Note that if a blood clot has already formed in the deep veins of the leg bedrest is usually prescribed and the treatment to prevent bloods with physical intervention is contraindicated Medication Anticoagulants and antiplatelets Thrombosis prophylaxis is often prescribed for hospitalized patients routinely by a number of means Anticoagulants are often prescribed Preoperatively some patients receive lowmolecularweight heparin once a day Additional risk factors such as obesity disease malignancies long surgeries and immobility may influence the prescribed dosage Anticoagulant medications prevent the formation of blood clots in people who are at high risk for their development Treating blood clots that have already formed is managed by the use of antihemolytic clot busters The list below describes some of the more common medications used to prevent blood clots Note that generally that since blood clotting is inhibited a side effect typically is bleeding though it can be reversed by administering a medication that stops the bleeding or by discontinuation of the medication itself Anticoagulant administration is often given before the start of the operation There are concerns with the potential of increased risk of bleeding and so many surgeons start giving anticoagulants the first 6 hours after surgeryMedications that inhibit blood clot formation include  Heparins         The discontinuation of contraceptives also prevents blood clots Herbal interactions The therapeutic effects of warfarin may be decreased by valerian Anticoagulants can be affected by chamomile Dong quai garlic ginger Ginkgo biloba bilberry and feverfew can increase bleeding time These same herbal supplements taken with warfarin increased prothrombin time Dietary interactions By containing significant content of vitamin K some foods act as antagonists to antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications these include green leafy vegetables like spinach legumes and broccoli Contraindications Preventing blood clots with medication is not considered safe in the following circumstances  Adding heparin to the use of compression stockings may prevent thrombosis Research An international registry and risk assessment calculator is being used to centralize data on postsurgical venous thrombosis and its prevention Hospitals are implementing a multidisciplinary approach to prevent of blood clots This includes adequate assessment of the risks follow up on missed doses of medication and instituting a patientcentered approach endorsed by the Joint Commission Recommendations regarding the prevention of blood clots vary widely between clinicians and treatment facilities Research continues to clarify these discrepancies The metabolic state of hypercoagulability the tendency to form blood clots tests are being developed These include the evaluation of the thrombin‚Äìantithrombin complexes TAT low levels of the anticoagulants ATIII and protein C but these tests are not yet widely available References  Using Wikipedia for Research  Bibliography Abele H

       "  'raw page text': 'Trans fat or transunsaturated fatty acids trans fatty acids are a type of unsaturated fat that occur in small amounts in nature but became widely produced industrially from vegetable fats for use in margarine snack food packaged baked goods and frying fast food starting in the 1950s Trans fat has been shown to consistently be associated in an intakedependent way with increased risk of coronary artery disease a leading cause of death in Western nations Fats contain long hydrocarbon chains which can either be unsaturated ie have double bonds or saturated ie have no double bonds In nature unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations In food production liquid cisunsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats which have more desirable physical properties eg they melt at a desirable temperature 30‚Äì40\\xa0¬∞C Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation which yields a trans fat Although trans fats are edible consumption of trans fats has been shown to increase the risk of coronary artery disease in part by raising levels of the lipoprotein LDL often referred to as bad cholesterol lowering levels of the lipoprotein HDL often referred to as good cholesterol increasing triglycerides in the bloodstream and promoting systemic inflammation Trans fats also occur naturally in a limited number of cases Vaccenyl and conjugated linoleyl CLA containing trans fats occur naturally in trace amounts in meat and dairy products from ruminants Most artificial trans fats are chemically different from natural trans fats Two Canadian studies have shown that the natural trans fat vaccenic acid found in beef and dairy products could actually be beneficial compared to hydrogenated vegetable shortening or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat by lowering total and LDL and triglyceride levels A study by the US Department of Agriculture showed that vaccenic acid raises both HDL and LDL cholesterol whereas industrial trans fats only raise LDL without any beneficial effect on HDL In light of recognized evidence and scientific agreement nutritional authorities consider all trans fats equally harmful for health and recommend that consumption of trans fats be reduced to trace amounts In 2003 the World Health Organisation recommended that trans fats make up no more than 1 of a persons diet In 2013 the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA issued a preliminary determination that partially hydrogenated oils which contain trans fats are not generally recognized as safe which was expected to lead to a ban on industrially produced trans fats in the American diet On 16 June 2015 the FDA finalized its determination that trans fats are not generally recognized as safe and set a threeyear time limit for their removal from all processed foods In other countries there are legal limits to trans fat content Trans fats levels can be reduced or eliminated using saturated fats such as lard palm oil or fully hydrogenated fats or by using interesterified fat Other alternative formulations can also allow unsaturated fats to be used to replace saturated or partially hydrogenated fats Hydrogenated oil is not a synonym for trans fat complete hydrogenation removes all unsaturated fats  History  Nobel laureate Paul Sabatier worked in the late 1890s to develop the chemistry of hydrogenation which enabled the margarine oil hydrogenation and synthetic methanol industries Whereas Sabatier considered hydrogenation of only vapors the German chemist Wilhelm Normann showed in 1901 that liquid oils could be hydrogenated and patented the process in 1902 During the years 1905‚Äì1910 Normann built a fathardening facility in the Herford company At the same time the invention was extended to a largescale plant in Warrington England at Joseph Crosfield amp Sons Limited It took only two years until the hardened fat could be successfully produced in the plant in Warrington commencing production in the autumn of 1909 The initial years production totalled nearly 3000 tonnes In 1909 Procter amp Gamble acquired the United States rights to the Normann patent in 1911 they began marketing the first hydrogenated shortening Crisco composed largely of partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil Further success came from the marketing technique of giving away free cookbooks in which every recipe called for Crisco Normanns hydrogenation process made it possible to stabilize affordable whale oil or fish oil for human consumption a practice kept secret to avoid consumer distaste Prior to 1910 dietary fats consisted primarily of butterfat beef tallow and lard During Napoleons reign in France in the early 19th century a type of margarine was invented to feed the troops using tallow and buttermilk it did not gain acceptance in the United States In the early 20th century soybeans began to be imported into the United States as a source of protein soybean oil was a byproduct What to do with that oil became an issue At the same time there was not enough butterfat available for consumers The method of hydrogenating fat and turning a liquid fat into a solid one had been discovered and now the ingredients soybeans and the need shortage of butter were there Later the means for storage the refrigerator was a factor in trans fat development The fat industry found that hydrogenated fats provided some special features to margarines which allowed margarine unlike butter to be taken out of the refrigerator and immediately spread on bread By some minor changes to the chemical composition of hydrogenated fat such hydrogenated fat was found to provide superior baking properties compared to lard Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil began to replace butterfat Hydrogenated fat such as Crisco and Spry sold in England began to replace butter and lard in the baking of bread pies cookies and cakes in 1920 Production of hydrogenated fats increased steadily until the 1960s as processed vegetable fats replaced animal fats in the United States and other Western countries At first the argument was a financial one due to lower costs advocates also said that the unsaturated trans fats of margarine were healthier than the saturated fats of butter As early as 1956 there were suggestions in the scientific literature that trans fats could be a cause of the large increase in coronary artery disease but after three decades the concerns were still largely unaddressed In fact by the 1980s fats of animal origin had become one of the greatest concerns of dieticians Activists such as Phil Sokolof who took out full page ads in major newspapers attacked the use of beef tallow in McDonalds french fries and urged fastfood companies to switch to vegetable oils The result was an almost overnight switch by most fastfood outlets to switch to trans fats Studies in the early 1990s however brought renewed scrutiny and confirmation of the negative health impact of trans fats In 1994 it was estimated that trans fats caused 20000 deaths annually in the United States from heart disease Mandatory food labeling for trans fats was introduced in several countries Campaigns were launched by activists to bring attention to the issue and change the practices of food manufacturers In January 2007 faced with the prospect of an outright ban on the sale of their product Crisco was reformulated to meet the United States Food and Drug Administration definition of zero grams trans fats per serving that is less than one gram per tablespoon or up to 7 by weight or less than 05 grams per serving size by boosting the saturation and then diluting the resulting solid fat with unsaturated vegetable oils A University of Guelph research group has found a way to mix oils such as olive soybean and canola water monoglycerides and fatty acids to form a cooking fat that acts the same way as trans and saturated fats Chemistry In chemical terms trans fat is a fat lipid molecule that contains one or more double bonds in trans geometric configuration A double bond may exhibit one of two possible configurations trans or cis In trans configuration the carbon chain extends from opposite sides of the double bond whereas in cis configuration the carbon chain extends from the same side of the double bond The trans molecule is a straighter molecule The cis molecule is bent A fatty acid is characterized as either saturated or unsaturated based on the presence of double bonds in its structure If the molecule contains no double bonds it is said to be saturated otherwise it is unsaturated to some degree Only unsaturated fats can be trans or cis fat since only a double bond can be locked to these orientations Saturated fatty acids are never called trans fats because they have no double bonds Therefore all their bonds are freely rotatable Other types of fatty acids such as crepenynic acid which contains a triple bond are rare and of no nutritional significance Carbon atoms are tetravalent forming four covalent bonds with other atoms whereas hydrogen atoms bond with only one other atom In saturated fatty acids each carbon atom besides the last is connected to its two neighbour carbon atoms as well as two hydrogen atoms In unsaturated fatty acids the carbon atoms that are missing a hydrogen atom are joined by double bonds rather than single bonds so that each carbon atom participates in four bonds  Hydrogenation of an unsaturated fatty acid refers to the addition of hydrogen atoms to the acid causing double bonds to become single ones as carbon atoms acquire new hydrogen partners to maintain four bonds per carbon atom Full hydrogenation results in a molecule containing the maximum amount of hydrogen in other words the conversion of an unsaturated fatty acid into a saturated one Partial hydrogenation results in the addition of hydrogen atoms at some of the empty positions with a corresponding reduction in the number of double bonds Typical commercial hydrogenation is partial in order to obtain a malleable mixture of fats that is solid at room temperature but melts upon baking or consumption In most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids the hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bonds of the carbon chain cis configuration\\xa0‚Äî from the Latin meaning on the same side However partial hydrogenation reconfigures most of the double bonds that do not become chemically saturated twisting them so that the hydrogen atoms end up on different sides of the chain This type of configuration is called trans from the Latin meaning across The trans configuration is the lower energy form and is favored when catalytically equilibrated as a side reaction in hydrogenation The same molecule containing the same number of atoms with a double bond in the same location can be either a trans or a cis fatty acid depending on the configuration of the double bond For example oleic acid and elaidic acid are both unsaturated fatty acids with the chemical formula C9H17C9H17O2 They both have a double bond located midway along the carbon chain It is the configuration of this bond that sets them apart The configuration has implications for the physicalchemical properties of the molecule The trans configuration is straighter while the cis configuration is noticeably kinked as can be seen from the threedimensional representation shown above The trans fatty acid elaidic acid has different chemical and physical properties owing to the slightly different bond configuration It has a much higher melting point 45\\xa0¬∞C than oleic acid 134\\xa0¬∞C due to the ability of the trans molecules to pack more tightly forming a solid that is more difficult to break apart This notably means that it is a solid at human body temperatures In food production the goal is not to simply change the configuration of double bonds while maintaining the same ratios of hydrogen to carbon Instead the goal is to decrease the number of double bonds and increase the amount of hydrogen in the fatty acid This changes the consistency of the fatty acid and makes it less prone to rancidity in which free radicals attack double bonds Production of trans fatty acids is therefore an undesirable side effect of partial hydrogenation Catalytic partial hydrogenation necessarily produces transfats because of the reaction mechanism In the first reaction step one hydrogen is added with the other coordinatively unsaturated carbon being attached to the catalyst The second step is the addition of hydrogen to the remaining carbon producing a saturated fatty acid The first step is reversible such that the hydrogen is readsorbed on the catalyst and the double bond is reformed The intermediate with only one hydrogen added contains no double bond and can freely rotate Thus the double bond can reform as either cis or trans of which trans is favored regardless the starting material Complete hydrogenation also hydrogenates any produced trans fats to give saturated fats Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture have investigated whether hydrogenation can be achieved without the side effect of trans fat production They varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted\\xa0‚Äî applying 1400\\xa0kPa 200\\xa0psi of pressure to soybean oil in a 2liter vessel while heating it to between 140\\xa0¬∞C and 170\\xa0¬∞C The standard 140\\xa0kPa 20\\xa0psi process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40 trans fatty acid by weight compared to about 17 using the highpressure method Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil the highpressureprocessed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6 trans fat Based on current US labeling requirements see below the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat The level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature and the length of time during hydrogenation Trans fat levels may be measured Measurement techniques include chromatography by silver ion chromatography on thin layer chromatography plates or small highperformance liquid chromatography columns of silica gel with bonded phenylsulfonic acid groups whose hydrogen atoms have been exchanged for silver ions The role of silver lies in its ability to form complexes with unsaturated compounds Gas chromatography and midinfrared spectroscopy are other methods in use Presence in food A type of trans fat occurs naturally in the milk and body fat of ruminants such as cattle and sheep at a level of 2‚Äì5 of total fat Natural trans fats which include conjugated linoleic acid CLA and vaccenic acid originate in the rumen of these animals CLA has two double bonds one in the cis configuration and one in trans which makes it simultaneously a cis and a transfatty acid Animalbased fats were once the only trans fats consumed but by far the largest amount of trans fat consumed today is created by the processed food industry as a side effect of partially hydrogenating unsaturated plant fats generally vegetable oils These partially hydrogenated fats have displaced natural solid fats and liquid oils in many areas the most notable ones being in the fast food snack food fried food and baked goods industries Partially hydrogenated oils have been used in food for many reasons Hydrogenation increases product shelf life and decreases refrigeration requirements Many baked foods require semisolid fats to suspend solids at room temperature partially hydrogenated oils have the right consistency to replace animal fats such as butter and lard at lower cost They are also an inexpensive alternative to other semisolid oils such as palm oil  Up to 45 of the total fat in those foods containing artificial trans fats formed by partially hydrogenating plant fats may be trans fat Baking shortenings unless reformulated contain around 30 trans fats compared to their total fats Highfat dairy products such as butter contain about 4 Margarines not reformulated to reduce trans fats may contain up to 15 trans fat by weight but some reformulated ones are less than 1 trans fat It has been established that trans fats in human milk fluctuate with maternal consumption of trans fat and that the amount of trans fats in the bloodstream of breastfed infants fluctuates with the amounts found in their milk In 1999 reported percentages of trans fats compared to total fats in human milk ranged from 1 in Spain 2 in France 4 in Germany and 7 in Canada and the United States Trans fats are used in shortenings for deepfrying in restaurants as they can be used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid In the early 21st century nonhydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available As fastfood chains routinely use different fats in different locations trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations For example an analysis of samples of McDonalds French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary and 28 times as much as in Denmark where trans fats are restricted At KFC the pattern was reversed with Hungarys product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product Even within the United States there was variation with fries in New York containing 30 more trans fat than those from Atlanta Nutritional guidelines The National Academy of Sciences NAS advises the United States and Canadian governments on nutritional science for use in public policy and product labeling programs Their 2002 Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy Carbohydrate Fiber Fat Fatty Acids Cholesterol Protein and Amino Acids contains their findings and recommendations regarding consumption of trans fat summary Their recommendations are based on two key facts First trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health whether of animal or plant origin Second while both saturated and trans fats increase levels of LDL trans fats also lower levels of HDL thus increasing the risk of coronary artery disease The NAS is concerned that dietary trans fatty acids are more deleterious with respect to coronary artery disease than saturated fatty acids This analysis is supported by a 2006 New England Journal of Medicine NEJM scientific review that states from a nutritional standpoint the consumption of trans fatty acids results in considerable potential harm but no apparent benefit Because of these facts and concerns the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption There is no adequate level recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary artery disease Despite this concern the NAS dietary recommendations have not recommended the elimination of trans fat from the diet This is because trans fat is naturally present in many animal foods in trace quantities and therefore its removal from ordinary diets might introduce undesirable side effects and nutritional imbalances if proper nutritional planning is not undertaken The NAS has therefore recommended that trans fatty acid consumption be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet Like the NAS the World Health Organization has tried to balance public health goals with a practical level of trans fat consumption recommending in 2003 that trans fats be limited to less than 1 of overall energy intake The US National Dairy Council has asserted that the trans fats present in animal foods are of a different type than those in partially hydrogenated oils and do not appear to exhibit the same negative effects While a recent scientific review agrees with the conclusion stating that the sum of the current evidence suggests that the Public health implications of consuming trans fats from ruminant products are relatively limited it cautions that this may be due to the low consumption of trans fats from animal sources compared to artificial ones More recent inquiry independent of the dairy industry has found in a 2008 Dutch metaanalysis that all trans fats regardless of natural or artificial origin equally raise LDL and lower HDL levels Other studies though have shown different results when it comes to animal based trans fats like conjugated linoleic acid CLA Although CLA is known for its anticancer properties researchers have also found that the cis9 trans11 form of CLA can reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease and help fight inflammation Health risks Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils have been an increasingly significant part of the human diet for about 100 years in particular since the later half of the 20th century and where more processed foods are consumed and some deleterious effects of trans fat consumption are scientifically accepted forming the basis of the health guidelines discussed above The exact biochemical process by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research One theory is that the human lipase enzyme works only on the cis configuration and cannot metabolize a trans fat although this theory has been overturned by the recognition that trans fat is metabolized but competitively inhibits the metabolism of other fatty acids Intake of dietary trans fat perturbs the bodys ability to metabolize essential fatty acids EFAs including Omega 3 leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta the main artery of the heart thereby increasing risk of coronary artery disease While the mechanisms through which trans fats contribute to coronary artery disease are fairly well understood the mechanism for trans fats effect on diabetes is still under investigation Trans fatty acids may impair the metabolism of longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids LCPUFAs but maternal pregnancy trans fatty acid intake has been inversely associated with LCPUFAs levels in infants at birth thought to underlie the positive association between breastfeeding and intelligence High intake of trans fatty acids can lead to many health problems throughout ones life Trans fat is abundant in fast food restaurants It is consumed in greater quantities by people who do not have access to a diet consisting of fewer hydrogenated fats or who often consume fast food A diet high in trans fats can contribute to obesity high blood pressure and a greater risk for heart disease Trans fat has also been implicated in the development of Type 2 diabetes Coronary artery disease The primary health risk identified for trans fat consumption is an elevated risk of coronary artery disease CHD A 1994 study estimated that over 30000 cardiac deaths per year in the United States are attributable to the consumption of trans fats By 2006 upper estimates of 100000 deaths were suggested A comprehensive review of studies of trans fats published in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine reports a strong and reliable connection between trans fat consumption and CHD concluding that On a percalorie basis trans fats appear to increase the risk of CHD more than any other macronutrient conferring a substantially increased risk at low levels of consumption 1 to 3 of total energy intake The major evidence for the effect of trans fat on CHD comes from the Nurses Health Study\\xa0‚Äî a cohort study that has been following 120000 female nurses since its inception in 1976 In this study Hu and colleagues analyzed data from 900 coronary events from the studys population during 14 years of followup He determined that a nurses CHD risk roughly doubled relative risk of 193 CI 143 to 261 for each 2 increase in trans fat calories consumed instead of carbohydrate calories By contrast for each 5 increase in saturated fat calories instead of carbohydrate calories there was a 17 increase in risk relative risk of 117 CI 097 to 141 The replacement of saturated fat or trans unsaturated fat by cis unhydrogenated unsaturated fats was associated with larger reductions in risk than an isocaloric replacement by carbohydrates Hu also reports on the benefits of reducing trans fat consumption Replacing 2 of food energy from trans fat with nontrans unsaturated fats more than halves the risk of CHD 53 By comparison replacing a larger 5 of food energy from saturated fat with nontrans unsaturated fats reduces the risk of CHD by 43 Another study considered deaths due to CHD with consumption of trans fats being linked to an increase in mortality and consumption of polyunsaturated fats being linked to a decrease in mortality There are two accepted tests that measure an individuals risk for coronary artery disease both blood tests The first considers ratios of two types of cholesterol the other the amount of a cellsignalling cytokine called Creactive protein The ratio test is more accepted while the cytokine test may be more powerful but is still being studied The effect of trans fat consumption has been documented on each as follows Cholesterol ratio This ratio compares the levels of LDL to HDL Trans fat behaves like saturated fat by raising the level of LDL but unlike saturated fat it has the additional effect of decreasing levels of HDL The net increase in LDLHDL ratio with trans fat is approximately double that due to saturated fat Higher ratios are worse One randomized crossover study published in 2003 comparing the effect of eating a meal on blood lipids of relatively cis and trans fat rich meals showed that cholesteryl ester transfer CET was 28 higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal and that lipoprotein concentrations were enriched in apolipoproteina after the trans meals Creactive protein CRP A study of over 700 nurses showed that those in the highest quartile of trans fat consumption had blood levels of CRP that were 73 higher than those in the lowest quartile Other health risks There are suggestions that the negative consequences of trans fat consumption go beyond the cardiovascular risk In general there is much less scientific consensus asserting that eating trans fat specifically increases the risk of other chronic health problems Alzheimers Disease A study published in Archives of Neurology in February 2003 suggested that the intake of both trans fats and saturated fats promote the development of Alzheimer disease although not confirmed in an animal model It has been found that trans fats impaired memory and learning in middleage rats The transfat eating rats brains had fewer proteins critical to healthy neurological function Inflammation in and around the hippocampus the part of the brain responsible for learning and memory These are the exact types of changes normally seen at the onset of Alzheimers but seen after six weeks even though the rats were still young Cancer There is no scientific consensus that consumption of trans fats significantly increases cancer risks across the board The American Cancer Society states that a relationship between trans fats and cancer has not been determined One study has found a positive connection between trans fat and prostate cancer However a larger study found a correlation between trans fats and a significant decrease in highgrade prostate cancer An increased intake of trans fatty acids may raise the risk of breast cancer by 75 suggest the results from the French part of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Diabetes There is a growing concern that the risk of type 2 diabetes increases with trans fat consumption However consensus has not been reached For example one study found that risk is higher for those in the highest quartile of trans fat consumption Another study has found no diabetes risk once other factors such as total fat intake and BMI were accounted for Obesity Research indicates that trans fat may increase weight gain and abdominal fat despite a similar caloric intake A 6year experiment revealed that monkeys fed a trans fat diet gained 72 of their body weight as compared to 18 for monkeys on a monounsaturated fat diet Although obesity is frequently linked to trans fat in the popular media this is generally in the context of eating too many calories there is not a strong scientific consensus connecting trans fat and obesity although the 6year experiment did find such a link concluding that under controlled feeding conditions longterm TFA consumption was an independent factor in weight gain TFAs enhanced intraabdominal deposition of fat even in the absence of caloric excess and were associated with insulin resistance with evidence that there is impaired postinsulin receptor binding signal transduction Liver dysfunction Trans fats are metabolized differently by the liver than other fats and interfere with delta 6 desaturase Delta 6 desaturase is an enzyme involved in converting essential fatty acids to arachidonic acid and prostaglandins both of which are important to the functioning of cells Infertility in women One 2007 study found Each 2 increase in the intake of energy from trans unsaturated fats as opposed to that from carbohydrates was associated with a 73 greater risk of ovulatory infertility Major depressive disorder Spanish researchers analysed the diets of 12059 people over six years and found those who ate the most trans fats had a 48 per cent higher risk of depression than those who did not eat trans fats One mechanism may be transfats substitution for docosahexaenoic acid DHA levels in the orbitofrontal cortex OFC Very high intake of transfatty acids 43 of total fat in mice from 2 to 16 months of age was associated with lowered DHA levels in the brain p0001 When the brains of 15 major depressive subjects who had committed suicide were examined postmortem and compared against 27 agematched controls the suicidal brains were found to have 16 less male average to 32 less female average DHA in the OFC The OFC controls reward reward expectation and empathy all of which are reduced in depressive mood disorders and regulates the limbic system Behavioral irritability and aggression a 2012 observational analysis of subjects of an earlier study found a strong relation between dietary trans fat acids and selfreported behavioral aggression and irritability suggesting but not establishing causality Diminished memory In a 2015 article researchers reanalyzing results from the 19992005 UCSD Statin Study argue that greater dietary trans fatty acid consumption is linked to worse word memory in adults during years of high productivity adults age lt45 Public response and regulation International The international trade in food is standardized in the Codex Alimentarius Hydrogenated oils and fats come under the scope of Codex Stan 19 Nondairy fat spreads are covered by Codex Stan 2562007 In the Codex Alimentarius trans fat to be labelled as such is defined as the geometrical isomers of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids having nonconjugated interrupted by at least one methylene group ‚àíCH2‚àí carboncarbon double bonds in the trans configuration This definition excludes specifically the trans fats vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid that are present especially in human milk dairy products and beef Argentina Since August 2006 food products should be labelled with the amount of trans fat in them Since 2010 vegetable oils and fats directly sold to consumers must only contain 2 of trans fat over total fat and other food must contain less than 5 of their total fat Starting on 10 December 2014 Argentina has on effect a total ban on food with trans fat a move that could save the government more than US100 million a year on healthcare Australia The Australian federal government has indicated that it wants to pursue actively a policy of reducing trans fats from fast foods The former federal assistant health minister Christopher Pyne asked fast food outlets to reduce their trans fat usage A draft plan was proposed with a September 2007 timetable in order to reduce reliance on trans fats and saturated fats Currently Australias food labeling laws do not require trans fats to be shown separately from the total fat content However margarine in Australia has been mostly free of trans fat since 1996 Austria Trans fat content limited to 4 of total fat 2 on products that contain more than 20 fat Belgium The Conseil Sup√©rieur de la Sant√© has published in 2012 a sciencepolicy advisory report on industrially produced trans fatty acids that focuses on the general population Its recommendation to the legislator was to prohibit more than 2 g of trans fatty acids  100 g of fat in food products Brazil Resolution 360 of 23 December 2003 by the Brazilian ministry of health required for the first time in the country that the amount of trans fat to be specified in labels of food products On 31 July 2006 such labelling of trans fat contents became mandatory In 2007 the ministry established a target to reduce the total amount of trans fat in any industrialized food sold in Brazil to a maximum of 2 by the end of 2010 Canada In November 2004 an opposition day motion seeking a ban similar to Denmarks was introduced by Jack Layton of the New Democratic Party and passed through the House of Commons by an overwhelming 193‚Äì73 vote Like all Commons motions it served as an expression of the views of the House but was not binding on the government and has no force under the law Since December 2005 Health Canada has required that food labels list the amount of trans fat in the nutrition facts section for most foods Products with less than 02\\xa0grams of trans fat per serving may be labeled as free of trans fats These labelling allowances are not widely known but as an awareness of them develops controversy over truthful labelling is growing In Canada trans fat quantities on labels include naturally occurring trans fats from animal sources In June 2006 a task force cochaired by Health Canada and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada recommended a limit of 5 trans fat of total fat in all products sold to consumers in Canada 2 for tub margarines and spreads The amount was selected such that most of the industrially produced trans fats would be removed from the Canadian diet and about half of the remaining trans fat intake would be of naturally occurring trans fats This recommendation has been endorsed by the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association and Food amp Consumer Products of Canada has congratulated the task force on the report although it did not recommend delaying implementation to 2010 as they had previously advocated Ten months after submitting their report the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada and Toronto Public Health issued a plea to the government of Canada to act immediately on the task forces recommendations and to eliminate harmful trans fat from Canadas food supply On 20 June 2007 the federal government announced its intention to regulate trans fats to the June 2006 standard unless the food industry voluntarily complied with these limits within two years On 1 January 2008 Calgary became the first city in Canada to reduce trans fats from restaurants and fast food chains Trans fats present in cooking oils may not exceed 2 of the total fat content However the replacement of local health regions with the Alberta Health Services Board in 2009 has temporarily eliminated all enforcement of the law Effective 30 September 2009 British Columbia became the first province in Canada to mandate the June 2006 recommendation in provincially regulated food services establishments On 15 September 2017 Health Canada announced that trans fat will be completely banned effective on 15 September 2018 Public perception A crosssectional study was conducted in Regina Saskatchewan in February 2009 at 3 different grocery stores located in 3 different regions that had the same median income before taxes of around 30000 Of the 211 respondents to the study most were women who purchased most of the food for their household When asked how they decide what food to buy the most important factors were price nutritional value and need When looking at the nutritional facts however they indicated that they looked at the ingredients and neglected to pay attention to the amount of trans fat This means that trans fat is not on their minds unless they are specifically told of it When asked if they ever heard about trans fat 98 said Yes However only 27 said that it was unhealthy Also 79 said that they only knew a little about trans fats and could have been more educated Respondents aged 41‚Äì60 were more likely to view trans fat as a major health concern compared to ages 18‚Äì40 When asked if they would stop buying their favorite snacks if they knew it contained trans fat most said they would continue purchasing it especially the younger respondents Also of the respondents that called trans fat a major concern 56 of them still wouldnt change their diet to nontrans fat snacks This is because taste and food gratification take precedence over perceived risk to health The consumption of trans fats and the associated increased risk of CHD is a public health concern regardless of age and socioeconomic status Denmark Denmark became the first country to introduce laws strictly regulating the sale of many foods containing trans fats in March 2003 a move that effectively bans partially hydrogenated oils The limit is 2 of fats and oils destined for human consumption This restriction is on the ingredients rather than the final products This regulatory approach has made Denmark the only country in which it is possible to eat far less than 1 g of industrially produced trans fats daily even with a diet including prepared foods It is hypothesized that the Danish governments efforts to decrease trans fat intake from 6 g to 1 g per day over 20 years is related to a 50 decrease in deaths from ischemic heart disease European Union In 2004 the European Food Safety Authority produced a scientific opinion on trans fatty acids surmising that higher intakes of TFA may increase risk for coronary heart disease Greece Law in Greece limits

2017 the law has not yet been implemented Switzerland Switzerland followed Denmarks trans fats ban and implemented its own beginning in April 2008 United Kingdom In October 2005 the Food Standards Agency FSA asked for better labelling in the UK In the edition of 29 July 2006 of the British Medical Journal an editorial also called for better labelling In January 2007 the British Retail Consortium announced that major UK retailers including Asda Boots Coop Iceland Marks and Spencer Sainsburys Tesco and Waitrose intended to cease adding trans fatty acids to their own products by the end of 2007 Sainsburys became the first UK major retailer to ban all trans fat from all their own brand foods On 13 December 2007 the Food Standards Agency issued news releases stating that voluntary measures to reduce trans fats in food had already resulted in safe levels of consumer intake On 15 April 2010 a British Medical Journal editorial called for trans fats to be virtually eliminated in the United Kingdom by next year The June 2010 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence NICE report Prevention of cardiovascular disease declared that 40000 cardiovascular disease deaths in 2006 were mostly preventable To achieve this NICE offered 24 recommendations including product labelling public education protecting under‚Äì16s from marketing of unhealthy foods promoting exercise and physically active travel and even reforming the Common Agricultural Policy to reduce production of unhealthy foods Fastfood outlets were mentioned as a risk factor with in 2007 170 g of McDonalds fries and 160 g nuggets containing 6 to 8 g of trans fats conferring a substantially increased risk of coronary artery disease death NICE made three specific recommendation for diet 1 reduction of dietary salt to 3 g per day by 2025 2 halving consumption of saturated fats and 3 eliminating the use of industrially produced trans fatty acids in food However the recommendations were greeted unhappily by the food industry which stated that it was already voluntarily dropping the trans fat levels to below the WHO recommendations of a maximum of 2 Rejecting an outright ban the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley launched on 15 March 2012 a voluntary pledge to remove artificial trans fats by the end of the year Asda Pizza Hut Burger King Tesco Unilever and United Biscuits are some of 73 businesses who have agreed to do so Lansley and his special Adviser Bill Morgan previously worked for firms with interests in the food industry and some journalists have alleged that this results in a conflict of interest Many health professionals are not happy with the voluntary nature of the deal Simon Capewell Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool felt that justifying intake on the basis of average figures was unsuitable since some members of the community could considerably exceed this United States  Before 2006 consumers in the United States could not directly determine the presence or quantity of trans fats in food products This information could only be inferred from the ingredient list notably from the partially hydrogenated ingredients In 2010 according to the FDA the average American consumed 58\\xa0grams of trans fat per day 26 of energy intake Monoglycerides and diglycerides are not considered fats by the FDA despite their nearly equal calorie per weight contribution during actual ingestion On 11 July 2003 the Food and Drug Administration FDA issued a regulation requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements The new labeling rule became mandatory across the board even for companies that petitioned for extensions on 1 January 2008 However unlike in many other countries trans fat levels of less than 05\\xa0grams per serving can be listed as 0\\xa0grams trans fat on the food label According to a study published in the Journal of Public Policy amp Marketing without an interpretive footnote or further information on recommended daily value many consumers do not know how to interpret the meaning of trans fat content on the Nutrition Facts panel In fact without specific prior knowledge about trans fat and its negative health effects consumers including those at risk for heart disease may misinterpret nutrient information provided on the panel The FDA did not approve nutrient content claims such as trans fat free or low trans fat as they could not determine a recommended daily value Nevertheless the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods However there is no requirement to list trans fats on institutional food packaging thus bulk purchasers such as schools hospitals jails and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items  Critics of the plan including FDA advisor Dr Carlos Camargo have expressed concern that the 05\\xa0gram per serving threshold is too high to refer to a food as free of trans fat This is because a person eating many servings of a product or eating multiple products over the course of the day may still consume a significant amount of trans fat Despite this the FDA estimates that by 2009 trans fat labeling will have prevented from 600 to 1200 cases of coronary artery disease and 250 to 500 deaths each year This benefit is expected to result from consumers choosing alternative foods lower in trans fats as well as manufacturers reducing the amount of trans fats in their products The American Medical Association supports any state and federal efforts to ban the use of artificial trans fats in US restaurants and bakeries The American Public Health Association adopted a new policy statement regarding trans fats in 2007 These new guidelines entitled Restricting Trans Fatty Acids in the Food Supply recommend that the government require nutrition facts labeling of trans fats on all commercial food products They also urge federal state and local governments to ban and monitor use of trans fats in restaurants Furthermore the APHA recommends barring the sales and availability of foods containing significant amounts of trans fat in public facilities including universities prisons and day care facilities etc On 7 November 2013 the FDA issued a preliminary determination that trans fats are not generally recognized as safe which was widely seen as a precursor to a reclassification of trans fats as a food additive meaning they could not be used in foods without specific regulatory authorization This would have the effect of virtually eliminating trans fats from the US food supply The ruling was formally enacted on 16 June 2015 requiring that within three years all food prepared in the United States must not include trans fats unless approved by the FDA State and local regulation Even before the federal ban the state of California and several US cities took action to reduce consumption of trans fats In 2005 Tiburon California became the first American city where all restaurants voluntarily cook with trans fatfree oils In 2007 Montgomery County Maryland approved a ban on partially hydrogenated oils becoming the first county in the nation to restrict trans fats New York City embarked on a campaign in 2005 to reduce consumption of trans fats noting that heart disease is the primary cause of resident deaths This has included a Public education campaign and a request to restaurant owners to eliminate trans fat from their offerings voluntarily Finding that the voluntary program was not successful New York Citys Board of Health in 2006 solicited public comments on a proposal to ban artificial trans fats in restaurants The board voted to ban trans fat in restaurant food on 5 December 2006 New York was the first large US city to strictly limit trans fats in restaurants Restaurants were barred from using most frying and spreading fats containing artificial trans fats above 05 g per serving on 1 July 2007 and were supposed to have met the same target in all of their foods by 1 July 2008 The Philadelphia City Council unanimously voted to enacted a ban in February 2007 and the measure was signed into law by Mayor John F Street The ordinance does not apply to prepackaged foods sold in the city but did require restaurants in the city to stop frying food in trans fats by September 1 2007 The ordinance also contained a provision going into effect one hear later that barred trans fat from being used as an ingredient in commercial kitchens The law On 10 October 2007 the Philadelphia City Council approved the use of trans fats by small bakeries throughout the city Nassau County a suburban county on Long Island New York banned trans fats in restaurants effective 1 April 2008 Bakeries were granted an extension until 1 April 2011 Albany County of New York passed a ban on trans fats The ban was adopted after a unanimous vote by the county legislature on 14 May 2007 The decision was made after New York Citys decision but no plan has been put into place Legislators received a letter from Rick J Sampson president and CEO of the New York State Restaurant Association calling on them to delay any action on this issue until the full impact of the New York City ban is known San Francisco officially asked its restaurants to stop using trans fat in January 2008 The voluntary program will grant a city decal to restaurants that comply and apply for the decal Legislators say the next step will be a mandatory ban Chicago also passed partial ban on oils and posting requirements for fast food restaurants Trans fat bans were also introduced in the state legislatures of Massachusetts Maryland and Vermont In March 2008 the Boston Public Health Commissions Board of Health passed a regulation food service establishments from selling foods containing artificial trans fats at more than 05\\xa0grams per serving which is similar to the New York City regulation there are some exceptions for clearly labeled packaged foods and charitable bake sales King County Washington passed a ban on artificial trans fats effective 1 February 2009 In July 2008 California became the first state to ban trans fats in restaurants effective 1 January 2010 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill into law California restaurants are prohibited from using oil shortening and margarine containing artificial trans fats in spreads or for frying with the exception of deep frying doughnuts As of 1 January 2011 doughnuts and other baked goods have been prohibited from containing artificial trans fats Packaged foods are not covered by the ban and can legally contain trans fats In 2007 the American Heart Association launched its Face the Fats campaign to help educate the public about the negative effects of trans fats and bring it into the large picture 2015‚Äì2018 phaseout In 2009 at the age of 97 University of Illinois professor Fred Kummerow a trans fat researcher who had campaigned for decades for a federal ban on the substance filed a petition with the US Food and Drug Administration FDA seeking elimination of artificial trans fats from the US food supply The FDA did not act on his petition for four years and in 2013 Kummerow filed a lawsuit against the FDA and the US Department of Health and Human Services seeking to compel the FDA to respond to his petition and to ban partially hydrogenated oils unless a complete administrative review finds new evidence for their safety Kummerows petition stated that Artificial trans fat is a poisonous and deleterious substance and the FDA has acknowledged the danger Three months after the suit was filed on June 16 2015 the FDA moved to eliminate artificial trans fats from the US food supply giving manufacturers a deadline of three years The FDA specifically ruled that trans fat was not generally recognized as safe and could no longer be added to food after June 18 2018 unless a manufacturer could present convincing scientific evidence that a particular use was safe Kummerow stated Science won out The ban is believed to prevent about 90000 premature deaths annually The FDA estimates the ban will cost the food industry 62 billion over 20 years as the industry reformulates products and substitutes new ingredients for trans fat The benefits are estimated at 140 billion over 20 years mainly from lower health care spending Food companies can petition the FDA for approval of specific uses of partially hydrogenated oils if the companies submit data proving the oils use is safe Food industry response Manufacturer response Palm oil a natural oil extracted from the fruit of oil palm trees that is semisolid at room temperature 15‚Äì25 degrees Celsius can potentially serve as a substitute for partially hydrogenated fats in baking and processed food applications although there is disagreement about whether replacing partially hydrogenated fats with palm oil confers any health benefits A 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats trans fats in the food industry because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does In May 2003 BanTransFatscom Inc a US nonprofit corporation filed a lawsuit against the food manufacturer Kraft Foods in an attempt to force Kraft to remove trans fats from the Oreo cookie The lawsuit was withdrawn when Kraft agreed to work on ways to find a substitute for the trans fat in the Oreo The JM Smucker Company American manufacturer of Crisco the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil This blend

Baconator for example to have 25 grams each 14 lb hamburger patty has a gram A large chains large fries typically had about 6 grams until around 2007 These reformulations can be partially attributed to 06 Center for Science in the Public Interest class action complaints and to New Yorks trans fat ban with companies such as McDonaldss stating they would not be selling a unique product just for New York customers but would implement a nationwide or worldwide change Although IHOP restaurants pledged in a 2007 press release to eliminate transfat from their food the nutrition information on the company website for the SummerFall 2015 Core Menu shows that they still have a considerable amount of trans fat in their food including 45 grams in their mega monster cheeseburger The Girl Scouts of

dihydrate It is a product of the oxidation of trimethylamine a common metabolite in animals Trimethylamine Noxide is an osmolyte found in saltwater fish sharks rays molluscs and crustaceans It is considered as a protein stabilizer that may serve to counteract urea the major osmolyte of sharks skates and rays It is also higher in deepsea fishes and crustaceans where it may counteract the proteindestabilizing effects of pressure TMAO decomposes to trimethylamine TMA which is the main odorant that is characteristic of degrading seafood    Synthesis TMAO can be synthesized from trimethylamine by treatment with hydrogen peroxide H2O2  CH33N ‚Üí H2O  CH33NO TMAO is biosynthesized from trimethylamine which is derived from choline Trimethylaminuria  Trimethylaminuria is a rare defect in the production of the enzyme flavin containing monooxygenase 3 FMO3 Those suffering from trimethylaminuria are unable to convert cholinederived trimethylamine into trimethylamine oxide Trimethylamine then accumulates and is released in the persons sweat urine and breath giving off a strong fishy odor Laboratory applications Trimethylamine oxide is used in protein folding experiments to counteract the unfolding effects of urea In the organometallic chemistry reaction of nucleophilic abstraction Me3NO is employed as a decarbonylation agent according to the following stoichiometry MCOn  Me3NO  L ‚Üí MCOn1L  Me3N  CO2 This reaction is used to decomplex organic ligands from metals eg from dieneFeCO3 It is used in certain oxidation reactions eg the conversion of alkyl iodides to the corresponding aldehyde Microbiotic associations The order Clostridiales the genus Ruminococcus and the taxon Lachnospiraceae are positively associated with TMA and TMAO levels In contrast proportions of S247 an abundant family from Bacteroidetes are inversely associated with TMA and TMAO levels Health issues Studies published in 2013 indicate that high levels of TMAO in the blood are associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events The concentration of TMAO in the blood increases after consuming foods containing carnitine or lecithin if the bacteria that convert those substances to TMAO are present in the gut High concentrations of carnitine are found in red meat some energy drinks and some dietary supplements lecithin is found in soy eggs as an ingredient in processed food and is sold as a dietary supplement Some types of normal gut bacteria eg species of Acinetobacter in the human microbiome convert dietary carnitine to TMAO TMAO alters cholesterol metabolism in the intestines in the liver and in artery wall In the presence of TMAO there is increased deposition of cholesterol in and decreased removal of cholesterol from peripheral cells such as those in the artery wall The link between cardiovascular diseases and TMAO is disputed by other researchers who are employees of Lonza a company that sells carnitine Clouatre et al argue that choline sources and dietary Lcarnitine do not contribute to a significant elevation of blood TMAO and the main TMAO source in the diet is fish Another source of TMAO is dietary phosphatidylcholine again by way of bacterial action in the gut Phosphatidyl choline is present at high concentration in egg yolks and some meats It has been suggested that TMAO may be involved in the regulation of arterial blood pressure and etiology of hypertension and thrombosis blood clots in atherosclerotic disease A 2017 metaanalysis found higher circulating TMAO was associated with 23 higher risk of cardiovascular events and a 55 higher risk of mortality Inhibition Vegan and vegetarian diets appear to select against gut flora that metabolize carnitine in favor of other gut flora more coordinated with their food supply This apparent difference in their microbiome is associated with substantially reduced gut bacteria capable of converting carnitine to trimethylamine which is later metabolized in the liver to TMAO 33Dimethyl1butanol DMB a structural analog of choline inhibits microbial TMA formation in mice and in human feces thereby reducing plasma TMAO levels after choline or carnitine supplementation It is found in some balsamic vinegars red wines and some coldpressed extra virgin olive oils and grape seed oils Resveratrol has been shown to reduce TMAO in mice by remodeling gut microbiota Effects of TMAO on Protein Stability The effects of TMAO on the backbone and charged residues of peptides are found to stabilize compact conformations whereas effects of TMAO on nonpolar residues lead to peptide swelling This suggests competing mechanisms of TMAO on proteins which accounts for hydrophobic swelling backbone collapse and stabilization of chargecharge interactions These mechanisms are observed in Trp cage References  See also Greenland shark ',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'An unsaturated fat is a fat or fatty acid in which there is at least one double bond within the fatty acid chain A fatty acid chain is monounsaturated if it contains one double bond and polyunsaturated if it contains more than one double bond Where double bonds are formed hydrogen atoms are subtracted from the carbon chain Thus a saturated fat has no double bonds has the maximum number of hydrogens bonded to the carbons and therefore is saturated with hydrogen atoms In cellular metabolism unsaturated fat molecules contain somewhat less energy ie fewer calories than an equivalent amount of saturated fat The greater the degree of unsaturation in a fatty acid ie the more double bonds in the fatty acid the more vulnerable it is to lipid peroxidation rancidity Antioxidants can protect unsaturated fat from lipid peroxidation    Chemistry and nutrition  Double bonds may be in either a cis or a trans isomer depending on the geometry of the double bond In the cis isomer hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond whereas in the trans isomer they are on opposite sides of the double bond see trans fat Saturated fats are useful in processed foods because saturated fats are less vulnerable to rancidity and usually more solid at room temperature than unsaturated fats Unsaturated chains have a lower melting point hence these molecules increase the fluidity of cell membranes Although both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can replace saturated fat in the diet trans unsaturated fats should not Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats helps lower levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the blood Trans unsaturated fats are an exception because the double bond stereochemistry predisposes the carbon chains to assume a linear conformation which conforms to rigid packing as in plaque formation The geometry of the cis double bond induces a bend in the molecule thereby precluding rigid formations see Trans fat ¬ß\\xa0Chemistry links above for drawings that illustrate this Natural sources of fatty acids see above are rich in the cis isomer Although polyunsaturated fats are protective against cardiac arrhythmias a study of postmenopauseal women with a relatively low fat intake showed that polyunsaturated fat is positively associated with progression of coronary atherosclerosis whereas monounsaturated fat is not This probably is an indication of the greater vulnerability of polyunsaturated fats to lipid peroxidation against which vitamin\\xa0E has been shown to be protective Examples of unsaturated fatty acids are palmitoleic acid oleic acid myristoleic acid linoleic acid and arachidonic acid Foods containing unsaturated fats include avocado nuts and vegetable oils such as canola and olive oils Meat products contain both saturated and unsaturated fats Although unsaturated fats are conventionally regarded as healthier than saturated fats the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA recommendation stated that the amount of unsaturated fat consumed should not exceed 30 of ones daily caloric intake Most foods contain both unsaturated and saturated fats Marketers advertise only one or the other depending on which one makes up the majority Thus various unsaturated fat vegetable oils such as olive oils also contain saturated fat In chemical analysis fatty acids are separated by gas chromatography of methyl esters additionally a separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by argentation thinlayer chromatography  Role of dietary fats in insulin resistance Incidence of Insulin resistance is lowered with diets higher in monounsaturated fats especially oleic acid while the opposite is true for diets high in polyunsaturated fats especially large amounts of arachidonic acid as well as saturated fats such as arachidic acid These ratios can be indexed in the phospholipids of human skeletal muscle and in other tissues as well This relationship between dietary fats and insulin resistance is presumed secondary to the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammation which is partially modulated by dietary fat ratios Omega369 with both omega 3 and 9 thought to be antiinflammatory and omega 6 proinflammatory as well as by numerous other dietary components particularly polyphenols and exercise with both of these antiinflammatory Although both pro and antiinflammatory types of fat are biologically necessary fat dietary ratios in most US diets are skewed towards Omega 6 with subsequent disinhibition of inflammation and potentiation of insulin resistance But this is contrary to the suggestion of more recent studies in which polyunsaturated fats are shown as protective against insulin resistance Membrane composition as a metabolic pacemaker Studies on the cell membranes of mammals and reptiles discovered that mammalian cell membranes are composed of a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA omega3 fatty acid than reptiles  Studies on bird fatty acid composition have noted similar proportions to mammals but with 13rd less omega3 fatty acids as compared to omega6 for a given body size This fatty acid composition results in a more fluid cell membrane but also one that is permeable to various ions H amp Na resulting in cell membranes that are more costly to maintain This maintenance cost has been argued to be one of the key causes for the high metabolic rates and concomitant warmbloodedness of mammals and birds However polyunsaturation of cell membranes may also occur in response to chronic cold temperatures as well In fish increasingly cold environments lead to increasingly high cell membrane content of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids to maintain greater membrane fluidity and functionality at the lower temperatures See also Iodine value ‚Äì a chemical analysis method to determine the proportion of unsaturated fat List of unsaturated fatty acids

       "  'raw page text': '  Vegetarian nutrition is the set of healthrelated challenges and advantages of vegetarian diets If wellplanned and fortified to balance their deficiencies vegetarian and vegan diets can become nutritionally adequate and can be appropriate for all stages of the life cycle including during pregnancy lactation infancy childhood and adolescence When fortified a vegetarian diet can provide adequate protein iron zinc vitamin B12 and calcium intake However in non fortified vegetarian diets and when not enough calories are consumed these nutrients can be dangerously low and may compromise childrens health and development Evidence suggests that vegetarians have lower rates of coronary heart disease obesity hypertension type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis Vegetarian diets tend to be rich in carbohydrates omega6 fatty acids dietary fibre carotenoids folic acid vitamin C vitamin E potassium and magnesium They are generally low in saturated fat cholesterol and animal protein    Health effects The Oxford Vegetarian Study showed that the health of vegetarians compares favourably with that of meateaters excluding pescetarians British vegetarians have lower death rates than nonvegetarians although this is at least partly due to nondietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and the generally high socioeconomic status of vegetarians or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish Loma Linda University School of Public Health has conducted three cohort studies that identify the health benefits of a vegetarian diet The University is a Seventhday Adventist health science institution The first study funded by the US Public Health Service in 1958 and limited to Adventists in California included many vegetarians The next cohort of California Adventists the Adventist Health Study1 AHS1 collected data from 1974 to 1976 From 2002 to 2007 the Adventist Health Study2 AHS2 collected dietary data from 96000 church members from the United States and Canada Many scientific articles have been published on the health and nutrition properties of a vegetarian diet from these cohort studies The most recent AHS2 study includes findings on metabolic syndrome Vitamin D absorption and type2 diabetes The 2010 version of Dietary Guidelines for Americans a report issued by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Health and Human Services every five years states that  In prospective studies of adults compared to nonvegetarian eating patterns vegetarianstyle eating patterns have been associated with improved health outcomes‚Äîlower levels of obesity a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and lower total mortality Several clinical trials have documented that vegetarian eating patterns lower blood pressure  On average vegetarians consume a lower proportion of calories from fat particularly saturated fatty acids fewer overall calories and more fiber potassium and vitamin C than do nonvegetarians Vegetarians generally have a lower body mass index These characteristics and other lifestyle factors associated with a vegetarian diet may contribute to the positive health outcomes that have been identified among vegetarians  Vegetarians may avoid the negative health effects of processed red meat A 1999 metastudy of five studies comparing vegetarian and nonvegetarian mortality rates in Western countries found that in comparison with regular meat eaters mortality from ischemic heart disease was 34 lower in people who ate fish but not meat pescetarians 34 lower in ovolacto vegetarians 26 lower in vegans and 20 lower in occasional meat eaters A 2010 study found that heart disease is not linked with unprocessed red meat Studies of cancer have not shown clear differences in cancer rates between vegetarians and nonvegetarians There is evidence that vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index lower risk of obesity lower blood cholesterol levels lower homocysteine levels lower risk of high blood pressure and lower risk of type 2 diabetes Combining proteins Despite a widespread belief that vegetarians must eat grains and beans within a few hours of each other to make a complete protein which contains all 9 essential amino acids this has never been substantiated by research The proteincombining theory was brought to popular attention in Frances Moore Lapp√©s 1971 bestseller Diet for a Small Planet In later editions of the book as early as 1981 Lapp√© withdrew her contention that protein combining is necessary Plant sources of protein include soy beans and soy products such as tofu veggie burgers soy milk etc other legumes nuts and seeds and grains Iron In several studies vegans and other vegetarians were not found to suffer from irondeficiency more than nonvegetarians However while one study agreed that irondeficiency anemia is not more common among vegetarians they found vegetarian children had  reduced levels of haemoglobin and iron compared to omnivores due to the absence of animal iron sources with high utilizability Another study in India found that strict vegetarian mothers as well as their newborns have a greater incidence and risk of anemia and iron deficiency  The recommended iron intake for vegetarians is 18 times that of nonvegetarians because plants dairy and eggs contain only nonheme iron and this is absorbed less efficiently than heme iron Although a lower percentage of nonheme iron is absorbed greater amounts of nonheme iron are concentrated in many nonmeat sources of iron than the amount of iron per serving in meats and therefore cereals eggs nuts seeds and legumes including soy foods peas beans chickpeas and lentils are significant sources of iron and a wellplanned vegetarian diet should not lead to iron deficiency but fruitarianism and raw foods diets should not be pursued for infants or children Meat fish and poultry not dairy or eggs are the only sources of heme iron intake of heme iron may be associated with colon cancer Nonheme iron is more sensitive to both inhibitors and enhancers of iron absorption Vitamin C is an iron absorption enhancer The main inhibitors for most people are phytates eg legumes and grains but other inhibitors include tannins tea wine calcium and polyphenols Iron is an integral part of many proteins and enzymes which maintain good health In humans iron is an essential component of proteins involved in red blood cells oxygen transport Iron also helps regulate cell growth and differentiation Zinc  Western vegetarians and vegans have not been found to suffer from overt zinc deficiencies any more than meateaters However phytates in many wholegrains and fiber in many foods may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects Vegetarians may need more than the US RDA 15\\xa0mg of zinc daily if their diet is high in phytates Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans sea vegetables fortified cereals soyfoods nuts peas and seeds Vitamin B12   Vitamin B12 deficiency is potentially extremely serious leading to megaloblastic anemia nerve degeneration and irreversible neurological damage Lactoovovegetarians may get vitamin B12 from eggs and dairy products milk cheese etc for some this is adequate but some may still remain B12deficient According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics the form of vitamin B12 sourced from animalproducts is proteinbound and not as easily digested especially as people age and therefore recommends B12 supplementation for everyone over the age of 50 Pregnant and lactating vegetarians and breastfed infants if the mothers diet is not supplemented should also use supplements whether pills injections or B12fortified foods if they dont get adequate B12 from animalproducts like eggs or dairy Generally humans need 243 micrograms of B12 each day Although some argue that developing a disease from B12 deficiency by following a sensible diet is extremely rare‚Äîless than one chance in a million there are cases to suggest that vegetarians and vegans who are not taking vitamin B12 supplements or food fortified with B12 do not consume sufficient servings of B12 and have abnormally low blood concentrations of vitamin B12 This is because unless fortified plant foods do not contain reliable amounts of active vitamin B12 It is essential therefore that vegetarians consume adequate amounts of dietary supplements or foods that have been fortified with B12 such as nutritional yeast or other yeast extracts vegetable stock veggie burger mixes textured vegetable protein soy milks vegetable and sunflower margarines and breakfast cereals B12 that is to be used in these supplements is typically grown from vegan sources such as bacteria Soybean and barley seeds grown in soils amended with cow dung which is naturally rich in B12 or with pure B12 had a higher B12 content than those grown without this supplementation There is a patent for cultivating plants in a solution containing vitamin B12 so that the crop contains more B12 Omega3 fatty acids  Vegetarian diets can be low in omega3 fatty acids O3FA Major vegetarian sources of O3FA include algae hempseeds and hempseed oil walnuts flaxseeds and flaxseed oil olive oil canola rapeseed oil avocado and chia seeds However diets lacking fish eggs or generous amounts of sea vegetables seaweed generally lack a direct source of longchain O3FA such as eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA Vegetarian diets may also have a high ratio of O6FA to O3FA which inhibits the conversion of shortchain fatty acids such as alphaLinolenic acid ALA found in most vegetarian O3FA sources to EPA and DHA Shortterm supplemental ALA has been shown to increase EPA levels but not DHA levels suggesting poor conversion of the intermediary EPA to DHA DHA and EPA supplements derived from microalgae are available  There is only weak evidence that omega3 benefits cardiovascular health and although omega3 has previously been thought useful for helping alleviate dementia as of 2016 there is no good evidence of effectiveness While there is little evidence of adverse health or cognitive effects due to DHA deficiency in adult vegetarians or vegans fetal and breast milk levels remain a concern EPA and DHA supplementation has been shown to reduce platelet aggregation in vegetarians but a direct link to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality which is already lower for vegetarians has yet to be determined Iodine  One study reported a potential danger of iodine deficiency disorders due to strict forms of vegetarian nutrition especially when fruits and vegetables grown in soils with low iodine levels are ingested Iodine however is usually supplied by iodized salt and other sources in first world countries Other significant sources of iodine include sea vegetables seaweed and bread made with dough conditioners See also China‚ÄìCornell‚ÄìOxford

       "  'raw page text': 'A vitamin is an organic compound and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts An organic chemical compound or related set of compounds is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities and it must be obtained through the diet thus the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism For example ascorbic acid one form of vitamin C is a vitamin for humans but not for most other animals Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people By convention the term vitamin does not include other essential nutrients such as dietary minerals essential fatty acids and essential amino acids Thirteen vitamins are universally recognized at present Vitamins are classified by both biological and chemical activity and not their structure Thus each vitamin refers to a number of vitamer compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin Such a set of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin generic descriptor title such as vitamin A which includes the compounds retinal retinol and four known carotenoids Vitamers by definition are convertible to the active form of the vitamin in the body and are sometimes interconvertible to one another as well Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions Some such as vitamin D have hormonelike functions as regulators of mineral metabolism or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation such as some forms of vitamin A Others function as antioxidants eg vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C The largest number of vitamins the B complex vitamins function as enzyme cofactors coenzymes or the precursors for them coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism In this role vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups For example biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules For example folic acid may carry methyl formyl and methylene groups in the cell Although these roles in assisting enzymesubstrate reactions are vitamins bestknown function the other vitamin functions are equally important Until the mid1930s when the first commercial yeastextract vitamin B complex and semisynthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold vitamins were obtained solely through food intake and changes in diet which for example could occur during a particular growing season usually greatly altered the types and amounts of vitamins ingested However vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and syntheticsource multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives since the middle of the 20th century Study of structural activity function and their role in maintaining health is called vitaminology    List of vitamins Each vitamin is typically used in multiple reactions and therefore most have multiple functions Health effects Vitamins are essential for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents a fetus begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things skin bone and muscle If there is serious deficiency in one or more of these nutrients a child may develop a deficiency disease Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage For the most part vitamins are obtained with food but a few are obtained by other means For example microorganisms in the intestine\\xa0‚Äî commonly known as gut flora\\xa0‚Äî produce vitamin K and biotin while one form of vitamin D is synthesized in the skin with the help of the natural ultraviolet wavelength of sunlight Humans can produce some vitamins from precursors they consume Examples include vitamin A produced from beta carotene and niacin from the amino acid tryptophan Once growth and development are completed vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells tissues and organs that make up a multicellular organism they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats and to help process the proteins carbohydrates and fats required for cellular respiration Supplements  In those who are otherwise healthy there is little evidence that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals but they may increase mortality though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that betacarotene supplements can be harmful While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess The European Union and other countries of Europe have regulations that define limits of vitamin and mineral dosages for their safe use as dietary supplements Most vitamins that are sold as dietary supplements are not supposed to exceed a maximum daily dosage referred to as the Tolerable upper intake level ULs Vitamin products above these regulatory limits are not considered supplements and should be registered as prescription or nonprescription overthecounter drugs due to their potential side effects The European Union United States Japan and some other countries each set ULs Dietary supplements often contain vitamins but may also include other ingredients such as minerals herbs and botanicals Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions In some cases vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects especially if taken before surgery with other dietary supplements or medicines or if the person taking them has certain health conditions They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher and in different forms than one may ingest through food Effect of cooking The USDA has conducted extensive studies on the percentage losses of various nutrients from different food types and cooking methods It should be noted however that some vitamins may become more bioavailable ‚Äì that is usable by the body ‚Äì when foods are cooked  The table below shows whether various vitamins are susceptible to loss from heat‚Äîsuch as heat from boiling steaming frying etc The effect of cutting vegetables can be seen from exposure to air and light Watersoluble vitamins such as B and C dissolve into the water when a vegetable is boiled and are then lost when the water is discarded Deficiencies Humans must consume vitamins periodically but with differing schedules to avoid deficiency The bodys stores for different vitamins vary widely vitamins A D and B12 are stored in significant amounts mainly in the liver and an adults diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years before developing a deficiency condition However vitamin B3 niacin and niacinamide is not stored in significant amounts so stores may last only a couple of weeks For vitamin C the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely from a month to more than six months depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores Deficiencies of vitamins are classified as either primary or secondary A primary deficiency occurs when an organism does not get enough of the vitamin in its food A secondary deficiency may be due to an underlying disorder that prevents or limits the absorption or use of the vitamin due to a lifestyle factor such as smoking excessive alcohol consumption or the use of medications that interfere with the absorption or use of the vitamin People who eat a varied diet are unlikely to develop a severe primary vitamin deficiency In contrast restrictive diets have the potential to cause prolonged vitamin deficits which may result in often painful and potentially deadly diseases Wellknown human vitamin deficiencies involve thiamine beriberi niacin pellagra vitamin C scurvy and vitamin D rickets In much of the developed world such deficiencies are rare this is due to 1 an adequate supply of food and 2 the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods fortification In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders Hypervitaminosis Some vitamins have documented side effects that tend to be more severe with a larger dosage The likelihood of consuming too much of any vitamin from food is remote but overdosing vitamin poisoning from vitamin supplementation does occur Acute symptoms can include nausea vomiting and diarrhea In the United States the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies has established Tolerable upper intake levels ULs for those vitamins which have documented side effects at high intakes In the European Union the European Food Safety Authority has also set ULs ULs from the two organizations do not always match In 2014 overdose exposure to all formulations of vitamins and multivitaminmineral formulations was reported by 68058 individuals to the American Association of Poison Control Centers with 73 of these exposures in children under the age of five Pharmacology Vitamins are classified as either watersoluble or fatsoluble In humans there are 13 vitamins 4 fatsoluble A D E and K and 9 watersoluble 8 B vitamins and vitamin C Watersoluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and in general are readily excreted from the body to the degree that urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption Because they are not as readily stored more consistent intake is important Fatsoluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids fats Because they are more likely to accumulate in the body they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are watersoluble vitamins Fatsoluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis History The value of eating a certain food to maintain health was recognized long before vitamins were identified The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver to a person may help with night blindness an illness now known to be caused by a vitamin A deficiency The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships crews In 1747 the Scottish surgeon James Lind discovered that citrus foods helped prevent scurvy a particularly deadly disease in which collagen is not properly formed causing poor wound healing bleeding of the gums severe pain and death In 1753 Lind published his Treatise on the Scurvy which recommended using lemons and limes to avoid scurvy which was adopted by the British Royal Navy This led to the nickname limey for British sailors Linds discovery however was not widely accepted by individuals in the Royal Navys Arctic expeditions in the 19th century where it was widely believed that scurvy could be prevented by practicing good hygiene regular exercise and maintaining the morale of the crew while on board rather than by a diet of fresh food As a result Arctic expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy and other deficiency diseases In the early 20th century when Robert Falcon Scott made his two expeditions to the Antarctic the prevailing medical theory at the time was that scurvy was caused by tainted canned food During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the use of deprivation studies allowed scientists to isolate and identify a number of vitamins Lipid from fish oil was used to cure rickets in rats and the fatsoluble nutrient was called antirachitic A Thus the first vitamin bioactivity ever isolated which cured rickets was initially called vitamin A however the bioactivity of this compound is now called vitamin D In 1881 Russian surgeon Nikolai Lunin studied the effects of scurvy at the University of Tartu in presentday Estonia He fed mice an artificial mixture of all the separate constituents of milk known at that time namely the proteins fats carbohydrates and salts The mice that received only the individual constituents died while the mice fed by milk itself developed normally He made a conclusion that a natural food such as milk must therefore contain besides these known principal ingredients small quantities of unknown substances essential to life However his conclusions were rejected by his advisor Gustav von Bunge even after other students reproduced his results A similar result by Cornelius Pekelharing appeared in a Dutch medical journal in 1905 but it was not widely reported  In East Asia where polished white rice was the common staple food of the middle class beriberi resulting from lack of vitamin B1 was endemic In 1884 Takaki Kanehiro a British trained medical doctor of the Imperial Japanese Navy observed that beriberi was endemic among lowranking crew who often ate nothing but rice but not among officers who consumed a Westernstyle diet With the support of the Japanese navy he experimented using crews of two battleships one crew was fed only white rice while the other was fed a diet of meat fish barley rice and beans The group that ate only white rice documented 161 crew members with beriberi and 25 deaths while the latter group had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause of beriberi but they mistakenly believed that sufficient amounts of protein prevented it That diseases could result from some dietary deficiencies was further investigated by Christiaan Eijkman who in 1897 discovered that feeding unpolished rice instead of the polished variety to chickens helped to prevent beriberi in the chickens The following year Frederick Hopkins postulated that some foods contained accessory factors\\xa0‚Äî in addition to proteins carbohydrates fats etc\\xa0‚Äî that are necessary for the functions of the human body Hopkins and Eijkman were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for their discoveries In 1910 the first vitamin complex was isolated by Japanese scientist Umetaro Suzuki who succeeded in extracting a watersoluble complex of micronutrients from rice bran and named it aberic acid later Orizanin He published this discovery in a Japanese scientific journal When the article was translated into German the translation failed to state that it was a newly discovered nutrient a claim made in the original Japanese article and hence his discovery failed to gain publicity In 1912 Polishborn biochemist Casimir Funk working in London isolated the same complex of micronutrients and proposed the complex be named vitamine It was later to be known as vitamin B3 niacin though he described it as antiberiberifactor which would today be called thiamine or vitamin B1 Funk proposed the hypothesis that other diseases such as rickets pellagra coeliac disease and scurvy could also be cured by vitamins Max Nierenstein a friend and reader of Biochemistry at Bristol University reportedly suggested the vitamine name from vital amine The name soon became synonymous with Hopkins accessory factors and by the time it was shown that not all vitamins are amines the word was already ubiquitous In 1920 Jack Cecil Drummond proposed that the final e be dropped to deemphasize the amine reference after researchers began to suspect that not all vitamines in particular vitamin A have an amine component In 1930 Paul Karrer elucidated the correct structure for betacarotene the main precursor of vitamin A and identified other carotenoids Karrer and Norman Haworth confirmed Albert SzentGy√∂rgyis discovery of ascorbic acid and made significant contributions to the chemistry of flavins which led to the identification of lactoflavin For their investigations on carotenoids flavins and vitamins A and B2 they both received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937 In 1931 Albert SzentGy√∂rgyi and a fellow researcher Joseph Svirbely suspected that hexuronic acid was actually vitamin C and gave a sample to Charles Glen King who proved its antiscorbutic activity in his longestablished guinea pig scorbutic assay In 1937 SzentGy√∂rgyi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery In 1943 Edward Adelbert Doisy and Henrik Dam were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of vitamin K and its chemical structure In 1967 George Wald was awarded the Nobel Prize along with Ragnar Granit and Haldan Keffer Hartline for his discovery that vitamin A could participate directly in a physiological process Etymology The term vitamin was derived from vitamine a compound word coined in 1912 by the Polish biochemist Kazimierz Funk when working at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine The name is from vital and amine meaning amine of life because it was suggested in 1912 that the organic micronutrient food factors that prevent beriberi and perhaps other similar dietarydeficiency diseases might be chemical amines This was true of thiamine but after it was found that other such micronutrients were not amines the word was shortened to vitamin in English Society and culture Once discovered vitamins were actively promoted in articles and advertisements in McCalls Good Housekeeping and other media outlets Marketers enthusiastically promoted codliver oil a source of Vitamin D as bottled sunshine and bananas as a ‚Äúnatural vitality food They promoted foods such as yeast cakes a source of B vitamins on the basis of scientificallydetermined nutritional value rather than taste or appearance World War II researchers focused on the need to ensure adequate nutrition especially in processed foods Robert W Yoder is credited with first using the term vitamania in 1942 to describe the appeal of relying on nutritional supplements rather than on obtaining vitamins from a varied diet of foods The continuing preoccupation with a healthy lifestyle has led to an obsessive consumption of additives the beneficial effects of which are questionable Governmental regulation Most countries place dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of foods not drugs As a result the manufacturer and not the government has the responsibility of ensuring that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed Regulation of supplements varies widely by country In the United States a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 There is no FDA approval process for dietary supplements and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994 The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements In 2007 the US Code of Federal Regulations CFR Title 21 part III took effect regulating Good Manufacturing Practices GMPs in the manufacturing packaging labeling or holding operations for dietary supplements Even though product registration is not required these regulations mandate production and quality control standards including testing for identity purity and adulterations for dietary supplements In the European Union the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription For most vitamins pharmacopoeial standards have been established In the United States the United States Pharmacopeia USP sets standards for the most commonly used vitamins and preparations thereof Likewise monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia PhEur regulate aspects of identity and purity for vitamins on the European market Naming The reason that the set of vitamins skips directly from E to K is that the vitamins corresponding to letters F‚ÄìJ were either reclassified over time discarded as false leads or renamed because of their relationship to vitamin\\xa0B which became a complex of vitamins The Germanspeaking scientists who isolated and described vitamin\\xa0K in addition to naming it as such did so because the vitamin is intimately involved in the coagulation of blood following wounding from the German word Koagulation At the time most but not all of the letters from F through to J were already designated so the use of the letter K was considered quite reasonable The table nomenclature of reclassified vitamins lists chemicals that had previously been classified as vitamins as well as the earlier names of vitamins that later became part of the Bcomplex There are other missing B vitamins which were reclassified or determined not to be vitamins For example B9 is folic acid and five of the folates are in the range B11 through B16 forms of other vitamins already discovered not required as a nutrient by the entire population like B10 PABA for internal use biologically inactive toxic or with unclassifiable effects in humans or not generally recognised as vitamins by science such as the highestnumbered which some naturopath practitioners call B21 and B22 There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins eg Bm There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances which some sources of the same type number up to D7 The controversial cancer treatment laetrile was at one point lettered as vitamin B17 There appears to be no consensus on any vitamins Q R T V W X Y or Z nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N or I although the latter may have been another form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type Antivitamins  Antivitamins are chemical compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins For example avidin is a protein in raw egg whites that inhibits the absorption of biotin it is deactivated by cooking Pyrithiamine a synthetic compound has a molecular structure similar to thiamine vitamin B1 and inhibits the enzymes that use thiamine See also  Provitamin

       "  'raw page text': 'Vitamin C megadosage is a term describing the consumption or injection of vitamin C ascorbate in doses comparable to the amounts produced by the livers of most other mammals Such dosages correspond to amounts well beyond the current Recommended Dietary Allowance of 90 mgday and often well beyond the Tolerable upper intake level of 2000 mgday Oral dosages are usually divided and consumed in portions over the day Injections of hundreds of grams per day are advocated by some physicians for the treatment of certain conditions poisonings or recovery from trauma People who practice vitamin C megadosage may consume many vitamin C pills throughout each day or dissolve pure vitamin C crystals in water or juice and drink it throughout the day Historic advocates of vitamin C megadosage include Linus Pauling who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 Pauling argued that due to a nonfunctional form of Lgulonolactone oxidase an enzyme required to make vitamin C that is functional in most other mammalian relatives humans have developed a number of adaptations to cope with the relative deficiency These adaptations he argued ultimately shortened lifespan but could be reversed or mitigated by supplementing humans with the hypothetical amount of vitamin C that would have been produced in the body if the enzyme were working Vitamin C megadoses are claimed by alternative medicine advocates including Matthias Rath and Patrick Holford to have preventative and curative effects on diseases such as cancer and AIDS but the available scientific evidence does not support these claims Some trials show some effect in combination with other therapies but this does not imply vitamin C megadoses in themselves have therapeutic effect    Background The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 45 mgday of vitamin C for healthy adults and 25‚Äì30\\xa0mgday in infants The Vitamin C article provides examples of recommendations from individual countries None exceed 110 mgday Vitamin C is necessary for production of collagen and other biomolecules and for the prevention of scurvy Vitamin C is an antioxidant which has led to its endorsement by some researchers as a complementary therapy for improving quality of life Since the 1930s when it first became available in pure form some physicians have experimented with higher than recommended vitamin C consumption or injection Certain animal species including haplorhine primates which includes humans members of the Caviidae family of rodents including guinea pigs and capybaras most species of bats many passerine birds and about 96 of fish the teleosts do not synthesize vitamin C internally Since its discovery vitamin C has been considered almost a panacea by some although this led to suspicions of it being overhyped by others Vitamin C has been promoted in alternative medicine as a treatment for the common cold cancer polio and various other illnesses The evidence for these claims is mixed Orthomolecularbased megadose recommendations for vitamin C are based mainly on theoretical speculation and observational studies such as those published by Fred R Klenner from the 1940s through the 1970s There is a strong advocacy movement for such doses of vitamin C and there is an absence of large scale formal trials in the 10 to 200 grams per day range The single repeatable side effect of oral megadose vitamin C is a mild laxative effect if the practitioner attempts to consume too much too quickly In the United States and Canada a tolerable upper intake level UL was set at 2000 mgday referencing this mild laxative effect as the reason for establishing the UL However the European Food Safety Authority EFSA reviewed the safety question in 2006 and reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for vitamin C The Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition reviewed the same question in 2010 and also reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL About 7090 of vitamin C is adsorbed by the body when taken orally at normal levels 30‚Äì180\\xa0mg daily Adsorption is only about 50 for daily doses of 1 g Oral administration even of mega doses cannot raise blood concentration above 022 mM Relative deficiency hypothesis  Humans and other species that do not synthesize vitamin C carry a mutated and ineffective form of the enzyme Lgulonolactone oxidase the fourth and last step in the ascorbateproducing machinery In the anthropoids lineage this mutation likely occurred 40 to 25 million years ago The three surviving enzymes continue to produce the precursors to vitamin C but the process is incomplete and the body then disassembles them In the 1960s the NobelPrizewinning chemist Linus Pauling after contact with Irwin Stone began actively promoting vitamin C as a means to greatly improve human health and resistance to disease His book How to Live Longer and Feel Better was a bestseller and advocated taking more than 10 grams per day orally thus approaching the amounts released by the liver directly into the circulation in other mammals an adult goat a typical example of a vitaminCproducing animal will manufacture more than 13000\\xa0mg of vitamin C per day in normal health and much more when stressed Matthias Rath is a controversial German physician who worked with and published two articles discussing the possible relationship between lipoprotein and vitamin C with Pauling He is an active proponent and publicist for highdose vitamin C Paulings and Raths extended theory states that deaths from scurvy in humans during the ice age when vitamin C was scarce selected for individuals who could repair arteries with a layer of cholesterol provided by lipoproteina a lipoprotein found in vitamin Cdeficient species Stone and Pauling believed that the optimum daily requirement of vitamin C is around 2300 milligrams for a human requiring 2500\\xa0kcal a day Pauling criticized the established US Recommended Daily Allowance pointing out that it is based on the known quantities that will prevent acute scurvy but is not necessarily the dosage for optimal health Adverse effects Although sometimes considered free of toxicity there are known side effects from vitamin C intake and it has been suggested that intravenous injections should require a medical environment and trained professionals A genetic condition that results in inadequate levels of the enzyme glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD can cause sufferers to develop hemolytic anemia after using intravenous vitamin C treatment G6PD deficiency test is a common laboratory test Vitamin C administration may acidify the urine that could promote the precipitation of kidney stones or drugs in the urine Because oxalic acid is produced in the metabolism of vitamin C hyperoxaluria can be caused by intravenous administration of ascorbic acid Blood levels of vitamin C remain steady at approximately 200\\xa0mg per day Although vitamin C can be well tolerated at doses well above what government organizations recommend adverse effects can occur at doses above 3\\xa0grams per day The common threshold side effect of megadoses is diarrhea Other possible adverse effects include increased oxalate excretion and kidney stones increased uricacid excretion systemic conditioning rebound scurvy preoxidant effects iron overload reduced absorption of vitamin B12 and copper increased oxygen demand and acid erosion of the teeth with chewing ascorbicacid tablets In addition one case has been noted of a woman who had received a kidney transplant followed by highdose vitamin C and died soon afterwards as a result of calcium oxalate deposits that destroyed her new kidney Her doctors concluded that highdose vitamin C therapy should be avoided in patients with renal failure Overdose As discussed previously vitamin C generally exhibits low toxicity The LD50 the dose that will kill 50 of a population is generally accepted to be 11900 milligrams 119\\xa0grams per kilogram in rat populations Interactions Pharmaceuticals designed to reduce stomach acid such as the protonpump inhibitors PPIs are among the most widely sold drugs in the world One PPI omeprazole Prilosec has been found to lower the bioavailability of vitamin C by 12 after 28 days of treatment independent of dietary intake The probable mechanism of vitamin C reduction intragastric pH elevated into alkalinity would apply to all other PPI drugs though not necessarily to doses of PPIs low enough to keep the stomach slightly acidic In another study 40\\xa0mgday of omeprazole lowered the fasting gastric vitamin C levels from 38 to 07\\xa0¬µgmL Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C Regulation There are regulations in most countries that limit the claims on the treatment of disease that can be placed on food and dietary supplement product labels For example Claims of therapeutic effect with respect to the treatment of any medical condition or disease are prohibited by the United States Food and Drug Administration even if substance has gone through well conducted clinical trials with positive outcomes Claims are limited to StructureFunction phrasing Helps maintain a healthy immune system and the following notice is mandatory on food and dietary supplement product labels that make these types of health claims These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration This product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease Research Cancer The use of vitamin C in high doses as a treatment for cancer was promoted by Linus Pauling based on a 1976 study published with Ewan Cameron which reported intravenous vitamin C significantly increased lifespans of patients with advanced cancer This trial was criticized by the National Cancer Institute for being designed poorly and three subsequent trials conducted at the Mayo Clinic could not replicate these results More recently in vitro data in animal models suggests intravenous ascorbic acid at high doses may hold some promise in the treatment of cancer however this has not been supported in more rigorous clinical trials in humans Preliminary clinical trials in humans have shown that it is unlikely to be a miracle pill for cancer and more research is necessary before any definitive conclusions about efficacy can be reached A 2010 review of 33 years of research on vitamin C to treat cancer stated we have to conclude that we still do not know whether Vitamin C has any clinically significant antitumor activity Nor do we know which histological types of cancers if any are susceptible to this agent Finally we dont know what the recommended dose of Vitamin C is if there is indeed such a dose that can produce an antitumor response The American Cancer Society has stated Although high doses of vitamin C have been suggested as a cancer treatment the available evidence from clinical trials has not shown any benefit Burns One study performed in 2000 used high intravenous doses of vitamin C 66\\xa0mgkghour over 24 hours for a total dose of around 110\\xa0grams after severe burn injury but despite being described as promising it has not been replicated by independent institutions and thus is not a widely accepted treatment Based on that study the American Burn Association ABA considers highdose ascorbic acid an option to be considered for adjuvant therapy in addition to the more accepted standard treatments However one medical review article noted vitamin C at the doses studied can be toxic and recommended further validation by future studies before this therapy is clinically used See also  Ascorbic acid Micronutrient

       "  'raw page text': 'The health effects of wine are mainly determined by its active ingredient alcohol Some studies found that drinking small quantities of alcohol up to one standard drink per day for women and one to two drinks per day for men is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease stroke diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome and early death However other studies found no such effect Drinking more than the standard drink amount increases the risk of heart disease high blood pressure atrial fibrillation stroke and cancer Mixed results are also observed in light drinking and cancer mortality Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents About 88000 deaths in the US are estimated to be due to alcohol each year Alcoholism reduces a persons life expectancy by around ten years and excessive alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States According to systematic reviews and medical associations people who are nondrinkers should not start drinking wine Wine has a long history of use as an early form of medication being recommended variously as a safe alternative to drinking water an antiseptic for treating wounds a digestive aid and as a cure for a wide range of ailments including lethargy diarrhea and pain from child birth Ancient Egyptian papyri and Sumerian tablets dating back to 2200 BC detail the medicinal role of wine making it the worlds oldest documented humanmade medicine Wine continued to play a major role in medicine until the late 19th and early 20th century when changing opinions and medical research on alcohol and alcoholism cast doubt on its role as part of a healthy lifestyle    Moderate consumption   Nearly all research into the positive medical benefits of wine consumption makes a distinction between moderate consumption and heavy or binge drinking Moderate levels of consumption vary by the individual according to age gender genetics weight and body stature as well as situational conditions such as food consumption or use of drugs In general women absorb alcohol more quickly than men due to their lower body water content so their moderate levels of consumption may be lower than those for a male of equal age Some experts define moderate consumption as less than one 5USfluidounce 150\\xa0ml glass of wine per day for women and two glasses per day for men The view of consuming wine in moderation has a history recorded as early as the Greek poet Eubulus 360 BC who believed that three bowls kylix were the ideal amount of wine to consume The number of three bowls for moderation is a common theme throughout Greek writing today the standard 750 ml wine bottle contains roughly the volume of three kylix cups 250\\xa0ml or 8\\xa0fl\\xa0oz each However the kylix cups would have contained a diluted wine at a 12 or 13 dilution with water In his circa 375 BC play Semele or Dionysus Eubulus has Dionysus say Effect on the body Bones Heavy alcohol consumption has been shown to have a damaging effect on the cellular processes that create bone tissue and longterm alcoholic consumption at high levels increases the frequency of fractures Epidemiological studies studies done by interviewing subjects and studying their health records have found a positive association between moderate alcohol consumption and increased bone mineral density BMD Most of this research has been conducted with postmenopausal women but one study in men concluded that moderate consumption of alcohol may also be beneficial to BMD in men Cancer  The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen Cardiovascular system   Studies have shown that heavy drinkers put themselves at greater risk for heart disease and developing potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias Excessive alcohol consumption can cause higher blood pressure increase cholesterol levels and weakened heart muscles Studies have shown that moderate wine drinking can improve the balance of lowdensity lipoprotein LDL or bad cholesterol to highdensity lipoprotein HDL good cholesterol which has been theorized as to clean up or remove LDL from blocking arteries The main cause of heart attacks and the pain of angina is the lack of oxygen caused by blood clots and atheromatous plaque build up in the arteries The alcohol in wine has anticoagulant properties that limits blood clotting by making the platelets in the blood less prone to stick together and reducing the levels of fibrin protein that binds them together Professional cardiology associations recommend that people who are currently nondrinkers should not start drinking alcohol Dementia and mental functions  One of the shortterm effects of alcohol is impaired mental function which can cause behavioral changes and memory impairment Longterm effects of heavy drinking can inhibit new brain cell development and increase the risk for developing major depressive disorders Studies have linked moderate alcohol consumption to lower risk of developing Alzheimers and dementia though wines role in this link is not yet fully understood A 2009 study by Wake Forest University School of Medicine suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may help healthy adults ward off the risks of developing dementia but can accelerate declining memory for those already suffering from cognitive impairment The reason for the potential positive benefit of moderate consumption is not yet identified and may even be unrelated to the alcohol but rather other shared lifestyle factors of moderate drinkers such as exercise or diets If it is the moderate consumption researchers theorize that it may be alcohols role in promoting the production of good cholesterol which prevents blood platelets from sticking together Another potential role of alcohol in the body may be in stimulating the release of the chemical acetylcholine which influences brain function and memory Diabetes Research has shown that moderate levels of alcohol consumed with meals does not have a substantial impact on blood sugar levels A 2005 study presented to the American Diabetes Association suggest that moderate consumption may lower the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes Digestive system  The antibacterial nature of alcohol has long been associated with soothing stomach irritations and ailments like travelers diarrhea where it was a preferred treatment to the less palatable bismuth treatments The risk of infection from the bacterium Helicobacter pylori strongly associated with causing gastritis and peptic ulcers as well as being closely linked to stomach cancer appears to lessen with moderate alcohol consumption A German study conducted in the late 1990s showed that nondrinkers had slightly higher infection rates of Helicobacter pylori than moderate wine and beer drinkers Wines positive effects on the metabolism of cholesterol has been suggested as a link to lower occurrences of gallstones among moderate drinkers since cholesterol is a major component of gallstones Headaches  There are several potential causes of socalled red wine headaches including histaminestyramines and the breakdown of some phenolic compounds in wine that carry the chemical messenger for serotonin One culprit that is regularly dismissed by allergists as an unlikely cause of red wine headaches is sulfites which are used as a preservative in wine Wine like other alcoholic beverages is a diuretic which promotes dehydration that can lead to headaches such as the case often experienced with hangovers In 2006 researchers from the University of California Davis announced finding from genetic mapping that amino acids in wine that have been slightly modified by the fermentation process may be the cause of wine related headaches The research suggest changes in fermentation techniques may help alleviate the risk for wine drinkers sensitive to these amino acids Calorie intake   Compared to many beers and nondiet sodas a serving of wine has a moderate amount of calories A standard 5 fl oz 150\\xa0ml serving of red wine based on an average alcohol content of 13 contains approximately 106 calories and 251\\xa0g of carbohydrates A similar serving of white wine contains approximately 100 calories and 118\\xa0g of carbohydrates Psychological and social Danish epidemiological studies suggest that a number of psychological health benefits are associated with drinking wine In a study testing this idea Mortensen et al 2001 measured socioeconomic status education IQ personality psychiatric symptoms and health related behaviors which included alcohol consumption The analysis was then broken down into groups of those who drank beer those who drank wine and then those who did and did not drink at all The results showed that for both men and women drinking wine was related to higher parental social status parental education and the social status of the subjects When the subjects were given an IQ test wine drinkers consistently scored higher IQs than their counterpart beer drinkers The average difference of IQ between wine and beer drinkers was 18 points In regards to psychological functioning personality and other healthrelated behaviors the study found wine drinkers to operate at optimal levels while beer drinkers performed below optimal levels As these social and psychological factors also correlate with health outcomes they represent a plausible explanation for at least some of the apparent health benefits of wine Heavy metals In 2008 researchers from Kingston University in London discovered red wine to contain high levels of toxic metals relative to other beverages in the sample Although the metal ions which included chromium copper iron manganese nickel vanadium and zinc were also present in other plantbased beverages the sample wine tested significantly higher for all metal ions especially vanadium Risk assessment was calculated using target hazard quotients THQ a method of quantifying health concerns associated with lifetime exposure to chemical pollutants Developed by the Environmental Protection Agency in the US and used mainly to examine seafood a THQ of less than 1 represents no concern while for example mercury levels in fish calculated to have THQs of between 1 and 5 would represent cause for concern The researchers stressed that a single glass of wine would not lead to metal poisoning pointing out that their THQ calculations were based on the average person drinking onethird of a bottle of wine 250\\xa0ml every day between the ages of 18 and 80 However the combined THQ values for metal ions in the red wine they analyzed were reported to be as high as 125 A subsequent study by the same university using a meta analysis of data based on wine samples from a selection of mostly European countries found equally high levels of vanadium in many red wines showing combined THQ values in the range of 50 to 200 with some as high as 350 The findings sparked immediate controversy due to several issues the studys reliance on secondary data the assumption that all wines contributing to that data were representative of the countries stated and the grouping together of poorly understood highconcentration ions such as vanadium with relatively lowlevel common ions such as copper and manganese Some publications pointed out that the lack of identifiable wines and grape varieties specific producers or even wine regions provided only misleading generalizations that should not be relied upon in choosing wines In a news bulletin following the widespread reporting of the findings the UKs National Health Service NHS were also concerned that the way the researchers added together hazards from different metals to produce a final score for individual wines may not be particularly meaningful Commentators in the US questioned the relevance of seafoodbased THQ assessments to agricultural produce with the TTB responsible for testing imports for metal ion contamination have not detected an increased risk George Solas quality assessor for the Canadian Liquor Control Board of Ontario LCBO claimed that the levels of heavy metal contamination reported were within the permitted levels for drinking water in tested reservoirs Whereas the NHS also described calls for improved wine labeling as an extreme response to research which provided few solid answers they acknowledged the authors call for further research to investigate wine production including the influence that grape variety soil type geographical region insecticides containment vessels and seasonal variations may have on metal ion uptake Chemical composition  Natural phenols and polyphenols Although red wine contains many chemicals under basic research for their potential health benefits resveratrol has been particularly well studied and evaluated by regulatory authorities such as the European Food Safety Authority and US Food and Drug Administration which identified it and other such phenolic compounds as not sufficiently understood to confirm their role as physiological antioxidants Cinnamates have been shown to have more antioxidant activity when exposed in vitro to the Fenton reaction catalytic FeII with hydrogen peroxide than the other natural phenols present in wine Resveratrol  Research on potential health effects of resveratrol is in its infancy and the longterm effects of supplementation in humans are not known Resveratrol is a stilbenoid phenolic compound found in wine produced in the grape skins and leaves of grape vines It has received considerable attention in both the media and medical research community for its potential health benefits which remain unproven in humans The production and concentration of resveratrol is not equal among all the varieties of wine grapes Differences in clones rootstock Vitis species as well as climate conditions can affect the production of resveratrol Also because resveratrol is part of the defence mechanism in grapevines against attack by fungi or grape disease the degree of exposure to fungal infection and grape diseases also appear to play a role The Muscadinia family of vines which has adapted over time through exposure to North American grape diseases such as phylloxera has some of the highest concentrations of resveratrol among wine grapes Among the European Vitis vinifera grapes derived from the Burgundian Pinot family tend to have substantially higher amounts of resveratrol than grapes derived from the Cabernet family of Bordeaux Wine regions with cooler wetter climates that are more prone to grape disease and fungal attacks such as Oregon and New York tend to produce grapes with higher concentrations of resveratrol than warmer dry climates like California and Australia Although red wine and white vine varieties produce similar amounts of resveratrol red wine contains more than white since red wines are produced by maceration soaking the grape skins in the mash Other winemaking techniques such as the use of certain strains of yeast during fermentation or lactic acid bacteria during malolactic fermentation can have an influence on the amount of resveratrol left in the resulting wines Similarly the use of certain fining agents during the clarification and stabilization of wine can strip the wine of some resveratrol molecules The prominence of resveratrol in the news and its association with positive health benefits has encouraged some wineries to highlight it in their marketing In the early 21st century the Oregon producer Willamette Valley Vineyards sought approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau TTB to state on their wine labels the resveratrol levels of their wines which ranged from 19 to 71 micromoles per liter higher than the average 10 micromoles per liter in most red wines The TTB gave preliminary approval to the winery making it the first to use such information on its labels While resveratrol is the most widely publicized there are other phenolic components in wine that have been the focus of medical research for potential health benefits including the compounds catechin and quercetin none of which has been proven to have any health value in humans Anthocyanins Red grapes are high in anthocyanins which are the source of the color of various fruits such as red grapes The darker the red wine the more anthocyanins present Following dietary ingestion anthocyanins undergo rapid and extensive metabolism that makes the biological effects presumed from in vitro studies unlikely to apply in vivo Although anthocyanins are under basic and earlystage clinical research for a variety of disease conditions there exists no sufficient evidence that they have any beneficial effect in the human body The US FDA has issued warning letters eg to emphasize that anthocyanins are not a defined nutrient cannot be assigned a dietary content level and are not regulated as a drug to treat any human disease History of wine in medicine  Early medicine was intimately tied with religion and the supernatural with early practitioners often being priests and magicians Wines close association with ritual made it a logical tool for these early medical practices Tablets from Sumeria and papyri from Egypt dating to 2200 BC include recipes for wine based medicines making wine the oldest documented humanmade medicine Early history   When the Greeks introduced a more systematized approach to medicine wine retained its prominent role The Greek physician Hippocrates considered wine a part of a healthy diet and advocated its use as a disinfectant for wounds as well as a medium in which to mix other drugs for consumption by the patient He also prescribed wine as a cure for various ailments ranging from diarrhea and lethargy to pain during childbirth The medical practices of the Romans involved the use of wine in a similar manner In his 1stcentury work De Medicina the Roman encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus detailed a long list of Greek and Roman wines used for medicinal purposes While treating gladiators in Asia Minor the Roman physician Galen would use wine as a disinfectant for all types of wounds and even soaked exposed bowels before returning them to the body During his four years with the gladiators only five deaths occurred compared to sixty deaths under the watch of the physician before him Religion still played a significant role in promoting wines use for health The Jewish Talmud noted wine to be the foremost of all medicines wherever wine is lacking medicines become necessary In his first epistle to Timothy Paul the Apostle recommended that his young colleague drink a little wine every now and then for the benefit of his stomach and digestion While the Islamic Koran contained restrictions on all alcohol Islamic doctors such as the Persian Avicenna in the 11th century AD noted that wine was an efficient digestive aid but because of the laws were limited to use as a disinfectant while dressing wounds Catholic monasteries during the Middle Ages also regularly used wine for medical treatments So closely tied was the role of wine and medicine that the first printed book on wine was written in the 14th century by a physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova with lengthy essays on wines suitability for treatment of a variety of medical ailments such dementia and sinus problems Risks of consumption The lack of safe drinking water may have been one reason for wines popularity in medicine Wine was still being used to sterilize water as late as the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 in order to control the spread of the disease However the late 19th century and early 20th century ushered in a period of changing views on the role of alcohol and by extension wine in health and society The Temperance movement began to gain steam by touting the ills of alcoholism which was eventually defined by the medical establishment as a disease Studies of the long and shortterm effects of alcohol caused many in the medical community to reconsider the role of wine in medicine and diet Soon public opinion turned against consumption of alcohol in any form leading to Prohibition in the United States and other countries In some areas wine was able to maintain a limited role such as an exemption from Prohibition in the United States for therapeutic wines that were sold legally in drug stores These wines were marketed for their supposed medicinal benefits but some wineries used this measure as a loophole to sell large quantities of wine for recreational consumption In response the United States government issued a mandate requiring producers to include an emetic additive that would induce vomiting above the consumption of a certain dosage level Throughout the mid to early 20th century health advocates pointed to the risk of alcohol consumption and the role it played in a variety of ailments such as blood disorders high blood pressure cancer infertility liver damage muscle atrophy psoriasis skin infections strokes and longterm brain damage Studies showed a connection between alcohol consumption among pregnant mothers and an increased risk of mental retardation and physical abnormalities in what became known as fetal alcohol syndrome prompting the use of warning labels on alcoholcontaining products in several countries French paradox and the benefits of consumption   The 1990s and early 21st century saw a renewed interest in the health benefits of wine ushered in by increasing research suggesting that moderate wine drinkers have lower mortality rates than heavy drinkers or teetotalers In November 1991 the US news program 60 Minutes aired a broadcast on the socalled French Paradox Featuring the research work of Bordeaux scientist Serge Renaud the broadcast dealt with the seemingly paradoxical relationship between the high fathigh dairy diets of French people and the low occurrence of cardiovascular disease among them The broadcast drew parallels to the American and British diets which also contained high levels of fat and dairy but which featured high incidences of heart disease One of the theories proposed by Renaud in the broadcast was that moderate consumption of red wine was a riskreducing factor for the French and that wine could have more positive health benefits yet to be studied Following the 60 Minutes broadcast sales of red wine in the United States jumped 44 over previous years This changing view of wine can be seen in the evolution of the language used in the US Food and Drug Administration Dietary Guidelines The 1990 edition of the guidelines contained the blanket statement that wine has no net health benefit By 1995 the wording had been changed to allow moderate consumption with meals providing the individual had no other alcoholrelated health risk From a research perspective scientists began differentiating alcohol consumption among the various classes of beverages ‚Äì wine beer and spirits This distinction allowed studies to highlight the positive medical benefits of wine apart from the mere presence of alcohol However wine drinkers tend to share similar lifestyle habits ‚Äì better diets regular exercise nonsmoking ‚Äì that may in themselves be a factor in the supposed positive health benefits compared to drinkers of beer and spirits or those who abstain completely References',\n",

       "  'raw page text': 'Zinc chloride hydroxide monohydrate is a zinc hydroxy compound with chemical formula Zn5OH8Cl2¬∑H2O It is often referred to as tetrabasic zinc chloride TBZC basic zinc chloride zinc hydroxychloride or zinc oxychloride It is a colorless crystalline solid insoluble in water Simonkolleite has been shown to be a desirable nutritional supplement for animals    Natural occurrence The naturally occurring mineral form simonkolleite was described as a new mineral in 1985 for samples collected at Richelsdorf Germany It is a rare secondary mineral formed by weathering of zincbearing slag and is associated with native zinc hydrocerussite diaboleite zincite and hydrozincite It is named after Werner Simon and Kurt Kolle Mineral collectors of Cornberg near Michelsdorf who submitted the samples for investigation Simonkolleite is frequently found as a corrosion product of Znbearing metals Structure Simonkolleite is rhombohedral space group R3m There are two crystallographically distinct zinc sites in Simonkolleite both of which are fully occupied by zinc The Zn1 site is coordinated by six hydroxyl OH groups in an octahedral geometry ZnOH6 The Zn2 site is coordinated by three OH groups and one Cl atom in a tetrahedral geometry ZnOH3Cl The ZnOH6 octahedra form an edgesharing dioctahedral sheet similar to that observed in dioctahedral micas On each site of the vacant octahedron a ZnOH3Cl tetrahedron is attached to three anions of the sheet and points away from the sheet Intercalated between adjacent sheets are interstitial water H2O groups The sheets are held together by hydrogen bonding from OH groups of one sheet to Cl anions of adjacent sheets and to interstitial H2O groups The ZnOH6 octahedra have four long equatorial bonds at 2157\\xa0√Ö and two short apical bonds at 2066\\xa0√Ö This apical shortening is a result of the bondvalence requirements of the coordinating OH groups and the connectivity of polyhedra in the structure The equatorial OH groups O1H are coordinated by two Zn1 cations and one Zn2 cation whereas the apical OH groups O2H are coordinated by three Zn1 cations As Zn1 is sixcoordinated and Zn2 is fourcoordinated the local bondvalence requirements require the Zn1O1 bonds to be considerably longer than the Zn1O2 bonds The ZnOH3Cl tetrahedron has three short Zn2O1 bonds at 1950\\xa0√Ö and one long Zn2Cl bond 2312\\xa0√Ö Figure 1  Properties Simonkolleite is colorless forms tabular hexagonal crystal up to 1 mm in diameter and has perfect cleavage parallel to 001 Thermal stability studies have shown that simonkolleite decomposes to ZnO at several stages upon heating eq 13 The decomposition starts with loss of a single mole of the lattice water Further dehydration at 165  210\\xa0¬∞C produces a mixture of ZnO and an intermediate ZnOHCl At 210  300\\xa0¬∞C the intermediate ZnOHCl decomposes to ZnO and ZnCl2 At higher temperature volatilization of zinc chloride occurs leaving a final residue of zinc oxide       Interestingly the dehydrated mixture ZnOHCl and ZnO is easily rehydrated and converted back to simonkoellete upon exposure to cool moist air eq 4   Simonkolleite is virtually insoluble in water and organic solvents soluble in mineral acids yielding the corresponding zinc salts eq 5 soluble in ammonia amine and EDTA solutions under complex formation It can easily be converted to zinc hydroxide by reacting with sodium hydroxide eq 6 Its pH in water is 69 measured by EPA method SW8469045     Preparation From hydrolysis of ZnCl2 Basic zinc chloride can be prepared by hydrolysis of a ZnCl2 solution in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide or ammonia eq 78     Simonkolleite nanodisks with a width of 40 nm have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method using zinc chloride and ammonia as the starting materials From reaction of ZnCl2 with ZnO Basic zinc chloride can be synthesized from the reaction of a ZnCl2 solution with ZnO eq 9   It can be synthesized from nanosized ZnO particles aged in aqueous ZnCl2 solution at 6  140\\xa0¬∞C for 48\\xa0h Elevating the aging temperature increases the crystallinity of basic zinc chloride Applications As a feed additive and nutrition supplement for animals Zinc is an essential trace element for all animals It is found in all organs and tissues of the body with bone muscle liver kidney and skin accounting for the majority of body zinc Zinc is commonly added to diets for animals in a supplemental form usually as inorganic feedgrade zinc oxide or zinc sulfate hydrate or one of the organic zinc chelates and complexes In several experiments zinc oxide has been shown to be less bioavailable for poultry and pigs than reagentgrade or feedgrade zinc sulfate however the sulfate forms are highly watersoluble and thus also hygroscopic under humid conditions Tetrabasic zinc chloride Simonkolleite a zinc hydroxy mineral is a new form of zinc nutrition supplement for animals When TBZC is made by a crystallization process Micronutrients TBZC it excludes contaminating ions providing a product with greater purity and fewer dust particles than occurs with precipitation The result is a crystalline solid that is essentially insoluble in water nonhygroscopic unreactive in most foods or feedstuffs and yet highly bioavailable Since TBZC is neutral and waterinsoluble it has excellent palatability and very low interactions with other ingredients in a food mixture compared to zinc chloride zinc sulfate or chelated forms of the metal It also avoids the problems with caking It has been shown that the relative zinc bioavailability for chicks in TBZC is two to three times higher than that in Waselzprocessed ZnO Research studies performed at universities and feed industry have all indicated that TBZC has a higher bioavailability relative to zinc sulfate with values ranging from 102 to 111 Four studies comparing TBZC to zinc oxide as a growth promoter all indicate improved weight gain and feed conversion at lower levels using TBZC Testing in vitro has shown better antimicrobial activity with TBZC than both zinc sulfate and zinc oxide Investigation on growth performance and some physiological parameters in the digestive tract of weanling piglets has shown that TBZC stimulated the synthesis and secretion of pancreatic chymotrypsin and may promote intestinal health As a stabilizing agent in nutritional and fungicidal compositions Basic zinc chloride has been used as a stabilizing agent in nutritional and fungicidal compositions for application to the foliage of growing plants As a Zn supplementation to metalloprotease therapy Tetrabasic zinc chloride has been used as a Zn supplementation for increasing responsiveness to therapeutic metalloproteases including increasing andor maximizing responsiveness and preventing botulinum and tetanus toxin resistance due to a functional deficiency of zinc In oral compositions Basic zinc chloride has been used as a therapeutically active agent in oral compositions for the care of teeth In coating compositions Basic zinc chloride in combination with watersoluble alkali metal silicate is used to coat substrates normally infested by algae such as concrete roofing tiles and other silicatecontaining building materials to prevent or minimize algal infestation that imparts a dark unsightly appearance A Znbased plating layer formed by basic zinc chloride and Mg has been shown to display excellent corrosion resistance In color development materials Basic zinc chloride is one of the three components to prepare color development materials used for pressuresensitive copying papers and thermosensitive recording papers References',\n",
